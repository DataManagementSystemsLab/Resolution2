Proposal for Micro-Credential in Fundamentals of Non-Fiction Video Production
Sponsoring school: School of Arts and Sciences, American Studies/Media & Communications

A. Purpose
The Micro-Credential in Fundamentals of Non-Fiction Video Production is designed for students
to develop basic video production and post-production skills for documentary, reporting or
advocacy. It consists of two sequential courses: AS3247 Introduction to Video and TV
(Renamed: Introduction to Multimedia Journalism, Spring 2020) followed by AS4852
Documentary Production. Students successfully completing the requirements of the
Micro-Credential will be able to research, plan, write, film and edit short non-fiction videos.
B. Demand
According to a 2018 report by researchers at Strada Education Network and Emsi, a labor
market analytics firm, tech firms are hiring more liberal arts majors with data showing an
“increase in liberal arts backgrounds into technical areas.” The report indicates that STEM and
tech employers seek students with critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration and
communication skills, in addition to technical skills. At the same time, with the expansion of
Internet streaming, video is a quickly growing field. According to the US Department of Labor
Bureau of Labor Statistics, Film and Video Editor and Camera Operator jobs have a projected
growth rate of 11% from 2018 - 2028. This is “much faster than the average for all occupations.”
It should be noted that these jobs are not purely technical. Many are related to content
development, journalism and creative expression. A liberal arts graduate, with the above
mentioned critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration and communication skills (including
strong writing skills and understanding of journalistic ethics) who also has technical credentials
will be well situated to move into creative, editorial and leadership positions in this growing field.
C. Resources
Both courses are already being offered as part of American Studies’ Media and
Communications degree. We propose expanding American Studies’ offerings of AS3247
Introduction to Video and TV by adding one additional evening section per academic year. Our
existing daytime Fall and Spring sections (2/2) are filling quickly, but we can’t yet reliably fill
evening, weekend or summer sections, despite a need in the major for some more seats. We
propose reserving M-Th daytime sections of AS3247 for majors only1. The new night section,
would be open to majors and non-majors. Because all sections of AS3247 share the same
equipment and do not utilize individual student equipment checkout, no additional resources will
be needed to support this one additional section. AS4852 is offered once a year and typically
runs with available seat, which we hope to fill by increasing demand through this
micro-credential. So to start, no additional courses will be needed to support this
micro-credential.

​Opening seats to non-majors only if not filled after the last round of transfer advising.

If demand for this micro-credentials increases, we will need to explore adding the following
resources: weekend and/or evening support (student workers) to expand the Media Innovation
Center edit lab and TV studio hours; purchase of additional video equipment for AS4852 student
checkouts; and accelerating our equipment refresh schedule to account for additional wear and
tear.
D. Cost, Financial Aid, Stackability, and Portability
Courses for this micro-credential will be offered at the regular tuition rate. The micro-credential
is stackable with the Media & Communications degree and M&C majors will be able to utilize
financial aid. For students who are not Media & Communications majors, micro-credential
courses will be eligible for financial aid if they fall within the college elective component of the
student's degree program (as with a minor). These are regular four credit college courses and
earned credits may be transferred to other SUNY institutions.
E. Title
The name “Fundamentals of Non-Fiction Video Production” is not the title of any registered
degree or certificate program.
F. Assessment
The Micro-Credential will be assessed along with the other programs in the American Studies /
Media & Communications department as part of its regular reviews.

A. Purpose
The Micro-Credential in Advanced TV/Video Production is designed for students who wish to
refine skills for creating high production value television programs and videos. Through project
based learning students will work toward creating a strong portfolio of video or TV work samples
for graduate school or entry level work placements. This micro-credential consists of two
courses. Students pick one of three options: AS4965 Video In Action, AS4935 TV In Action or
AS9000 Senior Media Fellow followed by AS5725 Senior Media Portfolio. Students successfully
completing the requirements of the Micro- Credential will leave with an online portfolio
showcasing short video or TV segments.

C. Resources
All four related courses are already being offered as part of American Studies’ Media and
Communications degree. AS5725 Senior Media Portfolio is offered every semester and typically
runs with available seats. We hope to fill these open seats by increasing demand through this
micro-credential. We offer AS4965 Video In Action and AS4935 TV in Action every other year
(alternating years) and both typically run with available seats, which we hope to fill by expanding
demand through this microcredential. If this microcredential increases demand, we will expand
offerings to run both courses annually (alternating semesters). AS9000 Senior Media Fellow,
like Internship, functions as an independent study for advanced TV and video students to
complete work under a faculty mentor, so this option is available every semester but only for our
most advanced students. AS4935 TV in Action is studio based, so requires no additional
equipment beyond the cameras set aside for OWTV reporting. AS4965 Video In Action can
utilize the cameras set aside for AS4852 Advanced Video: Documentary, with those courses
alternativen semesters. If demand increases, AS4935 and/or AS4965 could run during summer

sessions with no additional equipment resources. To start, no additional courses will be needed
to support this micro-credential.
If demand for this micro-credentials increases, we will need to explore adding the following
resources: weekend and/or evening support for the Media Innovation Center edit lab and TV
studio; purchase of additional video equipment for AS4935, AS4965, AS9000 and AS5725
student checkouts; and accelerating our equipment refresh schedule to account for additional
