"Whereas, several less violent alternatives have not been attempted and

international legal recourse has not been completely explored; and

Whereas, many innocent civilians are being killed or injured; and
Whereas, ill will toward the United States is being fomented; and
Whereas the stated goal of wiping out terrorism by waging war in
Afghanistan has little likelihood of succeeding; therefore
RESOLVED: that the Senate of the SUNY College at Old Westbury calls upon
President Bush and his administration to cease waging war in Afghanistan until all non-violent
and legal avenues to combating terrorism in that region have been
exhausted."
