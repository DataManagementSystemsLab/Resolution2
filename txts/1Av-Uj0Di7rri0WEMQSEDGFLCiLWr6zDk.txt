In Matters of the Physical Plant

which created opportunities for undergraduate research. Energy analyses initiated by FS came to the
attention of SUNY and NYSERDA (1997-2000), and led to opportunities for comprehensive
development of energy conservation measures, energy efficiency and cogeneration projects.

projects proposed for Old Westbury by NYSERDA, SAIC, LIPA, EnLink GeoEnergy (1998-2002).

In Matters of Governance Outreach
• Faculty Senate-led investigation, at the behest of 400+ students who submitted petition to FS Office
(regarding alleged misconduct within a certain department); report of Ad Hoc Ethics Committee was
presented at special meeting of FS (June 1996); broader recommendations led to establishment of
Faculty Rights & Responsibilities Committee as a Special (now standing) Committee of the Senate.

governance. In period 2005-2009, a concerted effort led to participation increasing from 35% to over
50% of FT faculty, with improved balance of senior/tenured and junior/untenured faculty. (Previously,
senior/tenured faculty had pre-dominated in governance.) In 2018-2019, about 58% of faculty were
participating in some aspect of governance. But over the past decade, balance has now shifted to a
greater proportion of junior/untenured to senior/tenured faculty serving in governance.

and FS workshops on the budget presented at SGA meetings. Outreach by faculty on Student Life (and
