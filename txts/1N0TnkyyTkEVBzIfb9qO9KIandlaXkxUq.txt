What is the length of time students will have to complete the proposed program? 5 years



k)     What are the admissions requirements for the new program, and how are they related to student success?  

Candidates must apply for the program by the end of Junior year.  They must have 12 credits of residency. All candidates must have completed four lab science courses and show a GPA of 3.25 overall and 3.25 in the courses required for the Chemistry B.A. degree.  An interview is required. The GRE is mandatory for all applicants. It is used as part of a holistic review of the candidate's application. Therefore, there is no minimum acceptable score. GRE scores will be evaluated along with other components of the candidate's dossier.  

Transfer students’ GPA must meet Old Westbury’s GPA requirements and transfer courses must be calculated along with Old Westbury grades for admission to this program.



Candidates must submit an application that includes

•	An essay

•	GRE scores

•	Two letters of reference from faculty

•	All college transcripts

Highly qualified candidates will complete the program in five years by accelerating undergraduate coursework, and moving on to graduate study in the fourth year.   Candidates must maintain a GPA of 3.25 (overall and in the major) in each semester of study.  Additionally, no grades of D are permitted for any required courses, and candidates must meet requirements of the Chemistry major.  Those whose GPA falls below 3.25will be placed on probation and will have one semester to bring up their grades.    Candidates who fail to complete the five-year program will be administratively transferred into the Chemistry major, and will graduate with the B.A. degree.

*Based on regulations, General Pedagogical Core Requirements (PCR) are applicable to all programs with exception of a) programs leading exclusively to initial certificates valid for teaching a specific career and technical subject; and b) programs leading exclusively to extensions/annotations.



The curriculum of the graduate courses offered by the School of Education has been updated to better prepare our candidates for the new certification requirements: Educating All Students Test (EAS), Academic Literacy Skill Test (ALST) and EdTPA. While ED6000: Foundation of Education offers a survey of all the new tests, ED6001: Human Growth and Development and ED6003: The Exceptional Learner focus more on the EAS test. The requirements for ALST are covered in ED6002: Foundation of Literacy and ED6092: Literacy, Research and Technology in Science. Candidates are instructed in how to prepare for the EdTPA in all their education courses, but more specific training occurs in ED6082: Method s and Materials of Teaching Science, ED6092: Literacy, Research and Technology in Science and of course in ED6900: Student Teaching. In this last course, candidates are provided an overview of all the NYSED certification requirements and attend several workshops that cover each test specifically. 





ED6000 Historical, Social, and Philosophical Foundations of Education: 3 credits 

This course examines the historical development of American education in the context of the nation’s social and philosophical traditions. Special attention will be given to the major social forces and movements that have shaped, and continue to shape, educational practice. We will explore the relationship between schools and society in the colonial period to the origins of the public (common) school to contemporary trends in constructivist ways of knowing. 

An important feature of this course is to understand and interpret the contribution that both social movements and the discipline of philosophy have contributed to the origin and development of modern education and schooling. We will pay particular attention to the conflicting interpretations regarding the role of schools in society, and how the various social movements and philosophical traditions that we will study struggled to address issues of cultural diversity in American education.



ED6001 Human Growth and Development: 3 credits

This course focuses on the development of learners from birth through adolescence, their phases of learning, their intellectual, social, and emotional growth, character development, individual differences, interests, attention, and motivation. The teacher candidates will understand how these aspects of human growth and development relate and influence the teaching/learning process. 




ED6002 Foundations of Literacy: 3 credits

This course examines literacy as an evolving language process. Theories of language acquisition will be addressed as 

a primary aspect of communication. The focus of this course will be communication aspects of literacy which includes listening, speaking (oral language), reading, and writing. These aspects are consistent with the NYS ELA Standards. 

An integral part of this course will be the elements of critical thinking. (Emphasis will be placed on topics such as: constructing meaning to convey information, the role of explicit instruction, vocabulary enhancement, assessing language, and the importance of literature enrichment.) 



ED6003 The Exceptional Learner: 3 credits

This course provides an introduction to the categories of exceptionality and the rules and regulations concerning the provision of special education and related services. There will be a focus on advanced professional, legal, and ethical standards. Advocacy and student services advocacy, and the application of computer-based technologies specific to working with students with disabilities will also be addressed. 


ED 6082: Methods and Materials of Teaching Science: 3 credits

Introduction to the main issues involved in teaching science at the secondary school level. The course has a focus on inquiry-driven methods consistent with current standards in science education, uses of technology and relevant software, teaching strategies, assessment, and inclusion of special student populations. The course is structured to enhance the development of science literacy, critical thinking, and problem solving with an emphasis on the teacher-as-learner. The course includes several mandatory on campus workshops covering the topics of child abuse prevention, school violence prevention and prevention of   harassment, bullying, cyberbullying and discrimination in schools.  Fieldwork under supervision.




ED6092 Literacy, Research, & Technology in Science: 3 credits

Introduction to research and practice in the analysis of syntax (rules and structure) and semantics (what is meant) within specific disciplines; reasons why many modern textbooks have removed logical connectives in order to improve readability; science learning involves words of increasing level of abstraction such as giving familiar objects new names, and giving new names to unfamiliar objects; process words like evaporation, distillation, condensation, evolution; concept words like work, energy, power, heat, force, an area where most learning difficulties are encountered; mathematical language as it applies to scientific measurements with an emphasis on graphical understanding of the uses of microcomputer-based laboratory techniques. The course includes field experience in the secondary schools. Fieldwork under supervision.


ED6900 Student Teaching –Science: 6 credits

In this course, students have school-based teaching experiences under the guidance of a cooperating teacher and a college supervisor at each school. Seventy-five days of mentored teaching will prepare student teachers to teach effectively both at the middle and high school levels. The mentoring teacher and the university supervisor will observe regularly and provide ongoing formative evaluations in close collaboration with the student. Student teachers will meet with the university supervisor in a weekly seminar throughout the semester. Prerequisites: Completion of all pedagogy and content courses.


	For programs leading to Initial certification, each requirement for field experience, student teaching and practica must meet the following regulatory requirements:  

	

It is consistent with the program's philosophy, purposes and objectives and carefully selected and planned by program faculty, with learning outcomes specified and their achievement regularly evaluated;



It is accompanied by coursework or seminars and supervised by one or more faculty who participate actively in the program and in program development, and who have training and skills in supervision and the expertise to provide supervision related to content and pedagogy. Full-time faculty shall participate in supervising students during their student-teaching or practica experiences; and



It provides candidates with experiences in a variety of communities and across the range of student developmental levels of the certificate, experiences practicing skills for interacting with parents or caregivers, experiences in high need schools, and experiences with each of the following student populations: socioeconomically disadvantaged students, students who are English language learners and students with disabilities.
