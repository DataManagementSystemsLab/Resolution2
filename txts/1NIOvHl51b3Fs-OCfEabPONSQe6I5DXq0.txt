Campus Green Committee
Introduction for Faculty Orientation
September 24, 2021

Who and What is the Campus GREEN Committee?
 GREEN is a college-wide committee of faculty, staff and students who engage in a
range of activities and initiatives that advance Old Westbury as a Green Campus,
consistent with the college’s Strategic Plan, Mission and Values.
 Faculty and staff may volunteer for membership or may be invited to join.
Students may be appointed by SGA or be recommended by faculty. The committee
currently has over 30 members, including over a dozen faculty from many disciplines.
What other organizations and programs does GREEN coordinate with?
 We support SUNY Sustainability policies, which are aligned with the UN Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs).
 We support New York State policies related to clean energy and climate action,
including goals established in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.
 We coordinate with the college’s United Nations Academic Impact program (UNAI).
 We engage with First-Year/CALL, Honor’s College and SOB Green Nudges.
 We engage with New York Coalition for Sustainability in Higher Education (NYCSHE).
 We work with NYSERDA (New York State Energy Research & Development Authority).


On the basis of Green Committee activities in 2019-2020 and application submitted
to NYSERDA, Old Westbury was accepted for membership in REV Campus Challenge
as ACHIEVER campus. (REV = Reforming the Energy Vision, by transition to renewable energy.)

Note:
The Campus Green Committee was re-established in 2019-2020, after previous convening in 2009-2010 as
ad hoc committee. The new committee’s initial burst of progress from its December 2019 kick-off meeting
to last in-person meeting in March 2020 was unfortunately impacted by Covid, given last year’s lack of
physical presence on campus, without students in residence. A robust agenda is planned for this year!

Some Major Areas of GREEN Activity:
 Energy/Emissions/Renewables
 Organic/Community Garden, Food Security
 Education/Outreach (sustainability, environmental justice, climate justice)
 Student Engagement/Research
 Recycling/Waste reduction
 Transportation (campus vehicles, charging stations)
 Environmental Stewardship (open space, aquifer, ecology)
 Communication (owgreen website, social media)
 Funding opportunities and partnerships
A few details on some GREEN activities proposed for 2021-2022:
 Proposal for NYSERDA Regional Energy Hub:
o Put together a team of local community partners to raise awareness of the disproportionate
impact of climate change and pollution on minority and disadvantaged communities.
o Through education and outreach, develop initiatives and activities to connect under-served
communities on Long Island with renewable energy opportunities and services, to ensure
that traditionally bypassed communities benefit from New York’s transition to clean energy.

 REV Campus Challenge:
o Pursue initiatives to increase renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions at the college,
in advancement of Old Westbury’s green campus goals and sustainability mission, and in
alignment with SUNY Sustainability and New York climate action goals.
o Carbon footprint study: explore existing models to evaluate campus progress towards SUNY
and NYS carbon emissions goals. Opportunity for student engagement/research.
o Carbon sequestration study: campus mapping project to evaluate carbon absorbed by
campus trees. Opportunity for student engagement/research.
o Solar PV and EV recharging stations: explore funding sources and possible connections to
community solar. Opportunity for student engagement and multi-disciplinary research.
o Climate Action Plan: explore REVCC support for climate action plan; refer to models on
other SUNY campuses. Opportunity for student engagement and multi-disciplinary research.

 Faculty and Student engagement:
o Develop initiatives, projects, activities and campus events, e.g., related to sustainability,
social justice, climate change, environmental justice, community outreach, etc.
o Prepare/participate in Earth Day presentations, panels, webinars, conferences and events.
o Develop proposals for sustainability policies and practices, in possible collaboration with
NYSERDA, SUNY Sustainability, NYCSHE and Johns Hopkins (graduate student)
o Opportunities for student research, service learning, Research Day presentations, and
possible support for attending regional conferences and events.
