REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (#19-01CEW)
Issued: September 4, 2018
Submission Deadline:
December 21, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. EST
I. INTRODUCTION
Recognizing SUNY’s demonstrated capacity in the areas of clean energy and workforce
development, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo proposed the Clean Energy Workforce
Opportunity Program (“Program”) in his 2016 Built to Lead Agenda, described as follows:
“To train 10,000 more workers for jobs in the clean energy sector, the
Governor proposes a new $15 million Clean Energy Workforce Opportunity
Program at the State University of New York (SUNY) that will work with
clean energy companies to develop a new job training and certification
program that will make New York a leader in clean tech workforce
development.
In partnership with clean energy businesses located on or near SUNY
campuses, the fund will allow schools to offer additional courses and hire
new faculty and purchase or upgrade the advanced machinery and lab
equipment necessary to teach students the skills to succeed in the green
energy workforce.”

York’s mission to be a leader in clean energy workforce development.
