CHANCELLOR’S AWARDS ELIGIBILITY AND SELECTION CRITERIA
NATURE OF THE PROGRAM
The Chancellor's Awards for Excellence are System-level honors conferred to acknowledge and provide
system-wide recognition for consistently superior professional achievement and to encourage the ongoing
pursuit of excellence. These programs underscore SUNY’s commitment to sustaining intellectual vibrancy,
advancing the boundaries of knowledge, providing the highest quality of instruction and service, and
serving the public good. Through these awards, SUNY publicly proclaims its pride in the accomplishment
and personal dedication of its instructional faculty, librarians, and professional staff across its campuses.
The awards provide SUNY-wide recognition in five categories: Faculty Service, Librarianship, Professional
Service, Scholarship and Creative Activities, and Teaching.
REWARDS OF SELECTION
Individuals selected for this tribute are the SUNY community’s role models. In acknowledgment of their
selection, recipients will be given recognition for the particular award received in the college catalogue by
the addition of the phrase "State University Chancellor's Award for Excellence in …” A letter, certificate and
a Chancellor’s Award for Excellence Medallion are also bestowed to commemorate selection. In addition,
campuses are encouraged to supplement these commemoratives as appropriate to campus resources.
Frequently, those selected are honored by their campuses during commencement, at academic
convocations, or at special events hosted in honor of their selection.
CAMPUS PARTICIPATION
All State University of New York campuses may nominate candidates for these awards: doctoral degree
granting institutions, university colleges, technology colleges, and community colleges. Campus
participation in the programs, however, is at the discretion of the campus President but all campuses are
encouraged to participate.
NUMBER OF NOMINATIONS (NOMINATION ALLOCATIONS)
A limit is placed on the number of candidates a campus may submit to each program in order to preserve
the honor and prestige of selection. These caps are formula-driven and based on the ratio to campus FullTime Equivalent (FTE) students shown below:
Librarianship
1 per 7,000 FTEs

Faculty Service and Scholarship and
Creative Activities
1 per 5,000 FTEs

Professional Service
1 per 2,500 FTEs

Teaching
1 per 2,000 FTEs

Regardless of the ratio, each campus may submit one nomination to each program annually. The number
of nominations allocated to each campus is appended to these guidelines. Nomination allocations are not
interchangeable from program to program, nor can they be carried forward from year to year. Campuses
submitting more than their allocation of nominations will have all nominations returned without review.
There is no requirement to nominate annually, nor will the absence of submissions in any cycle be
detrimental to campus nominations made in subsequent cycles.

CANDIDATE CHARACTERISTICS
Individuals nominated for these awards must meet all prescribed eligibility criteria and must fulfill – and
preferably surpass – the selection criteria for the specific award for which they are being nominated. In all
cases, candidates must be individuals of achievement, committed to the State University and its students,
respected by the campus community and worthy of emulation by colleagues and students on the home
campus and across SUNY.
ELIGIBILITY
Each award has program-specific eligibility criteria; nonetheless, there are eligibility criteria common to all.
Regardless of program, nominees must have completed three academic years of full-time
appointment at the nominating campus out of the five years just prior to the year of nomination.
Individuals serving in part-time, or visiting capacities – irrespective of the length of their service or amount
of their involvement – are ineligible for these programs. Full-time Clinical faculty and full-time nontenure track faculty are eligible for nomination in the following categories: Faculty Service,
Scholarship and Creative Activities, and Teaching. Please see eligibility chart noted below.

PROGRAM SPECIFIC ELIGIBILITY AND SELECTION CRITERIA
EXCELLENCE IN FACULTY SERVICE – (EIFS)
Nature of the Program – EIFS
The Chancellor’s Award for Excellence in Faculty Service recognizes the consistently superior service
contributions of teaching faculty. This service must be sustained over multiple years and may occur in a
variety of venues.
Selection Criteria – EIFS
To be nominated, a faculty member must demonstrate consistently superior service. Eligible service
contributions may occur in a variety of areas including service to the campus, the State University, the local
community, or contributions at the regional, state-wide, national or international levels. Eligible activities
may encompass a combination of service contributions to discipline or disciplinary and professional
organizations and societies, and to leadership in local or system-wide faculty governance.
The nature of the service must exceed the work generally considered to be part of a candidate’s basic
professional obligation (professional committees, etc.) and must include service that exceeds that for
which faculty are normally compensated. There must be positive evidence of outstanding achievement
and skill in providing leadership, outreach, or other University and/or community service or extraordinary
service and leadership in the nominee’s professional organizations.
The scope of the service must extend over multiple years, must be geared toward effecting positive change
and must involve the generous giving of personal time in service to areas previously described. Candidates
for this award must be full-time teaching/instructional faculty who meet, and preferably exceed, the
selection criteria, and who also demonstrate initiative and creativity in exceeding these standards.
Eligibility – EIFS
Academic Background – Candidates must regularly carry a full-time teaching load as defined by the
campus for full-time teaching. (The definition of a full teaching load varies from campus to campus,
but each campus should be satisfied that there can be no question that its nominee meets this
criterion. Teachers of studio courses or other specialized courses in which credit hours are
normally low are to be considered in terms of the full-time load normally expected for the
discipline.)
The significance of having the campus define “full-time” teaching is particularly relevant in the case of
Department Chairs. Campuses frequently provide course reductions for faculty serving in such capacities.
If the reduction is applied uniformly, then this reduced load becomes “full-time” for that particular position.
Individuals serving in this capacity may be nominated for the award contingent upon their carrying the
campus-defined, full-time teaching load for persons performing such administrative responsibilities (e.g., if
a campus defines 15 hours as a full-time teaching load for full-time faculty, and 12 hours as a full-time
teaching load for Department Chairs, then an individual serving as a Department Chair and teaching the 12
3

hours and meeting the other eligibility requirements would be eligible for nomination). The nomination
portfolio should clearly indicate that the Department Chair is carrying a campus-defined full-time
teaching load as defined for Department Chairs.
Except for Department Chairs, teaching requirements must constitute more than 50 percent of the
position’s responsibility. Otherwise, the individual should be considered for the Excellence in
Professional Service Award. Please remember that Department Chairs are always considered
faculty first, and it is the intent that the Professional Service category be reserved for staff.
Academic Rank – Nominees for the award may hold any full-time academic rank as defined in SUNY
Board of Trustees policies: professor, associate professor, assistant professor, instructor or assistant
instructor, or clinical professor. Please note the State University of New York Policies of the Board of
Trustees – April 2017 – Article II - §1 (Terms).

EXCELLENCE IN LIBRARIANSHIP (EIL)
Nature of the Program – EIL
The Chancellor’s Award for Excellence in Librarianship recognizes consistently superior professional
achievement in the field of librarianship.
Selection Criteria – EIL
Nominees for the award must have demonstrated extraordinary performance in the following areas:
Skill in Librarianship – There must be positive evidence that the candidate performs superbly in
fulfilling his or her librarianship duties. Consideration should be given to the candidate's ability to
perform this function in a creative and innovative fashion that is of outstanding quality.
Service to the University and to the Profession – There must be evidence that the candidate is
flexible and adapts readily to the needs of constituents served. Eligible service areas include
contributions to the library, the campus, the State University, the community and to the profession.
Scholarship and Continuing Professional Growth – The candidate must keep abreast of
developments in the field and use relevant contemporary data in relation to that person’s work
situation. Evidence in this category should include references to publications, membership and
work in professional organizations, attendance at meetings, seminars, etc.
Eligibility Criteria – EIL
Academic Background – Candidates must hold full-time appointment as a faculty librarian and must
possess a Master of Library Science (MLS) or equivalent (e.g., MLIS).

4

Academic Rank – Candidates may hold any academic rank as defined in the SUNY Board of Trustees
policies: librarian, associate librarian, senior assistant librarian and assistant librarian. Please note the
State University of New York Policies of the Board of Trustees – April 2017 – Article II - §1 (Terms).
Restrictions – Individuals serving as head of the campus library – or of all the libraries for institutions with
multiple libraries – are ineligible for nomination. However, the head of the library may be eligible for the
Excellence in Professional Service Award if this individual satisfies the other selection and eligibility criteria
for that award.

EXCELLENCE IN PROFESSIONAL SERVICE (EIPS)
Nature of the Program – EIPS
The Chancellor’s Award for Excellence in Professional Service recognizes consistently superior
professional achievement within and beyond the position.
Selection Criteria – EIPS
Nominees for the award must be individuals who have repeatedly sought improvement of themselves, their
campuses and ultimately the State University and, in doing so, have transcended the normal definitions of
excellence.
At all position levels, nominees shall be those individuals who can serve as professional role
models for a University system in the pursuit of excellence. The following criteria shall be used in
selecting persons for nomination of this award:
Within the Position Description – The candidate must perform superbly in fulfilling the job
description for the position held; and
Beyond the Position Description – The candidate should also demonstrate excellence in
professional activities beyond the parameters of the job description. The ideal candidate will
satisfy the standards in a creative and innovative fashion while demonstrating flexibility and adaptability to institutional needs. Consideration should be given to capabilities and accomplishments in
the areas of leadership, decision-making and problem-solving. Evidence in this category includes,
but is not limited to, professional recognitions, initiation of ideas, development of proposals, and
committee activities.
Eligibility Criteria – EIPS
Candidate Background – Candidates must presently be serving in full-time professional service capacities
(not necessarily titles) with more than 50 percent of their assignment in non-teaching services. The latter
include academic administration, business affairs, student affairs, institutional support technologies,
instructional and research support technologies, and directors of campus libraries. It is the intent that the
Professional Service award be reserved for staff working full-time within their nominating campus. Full-time
faculty (as defined in the eligibility criteria for Faculty Service) are not eligible. In the case of splitassignments across the nominating campus, individuals are eligible for nomination for this award if they are
5

serving in a full-time professional capacity. In addition, support staff not serving in professional class titles
are ineligible for nomination, but are eligible for nomination in the Classified Service Awards category.
Please note, promotion within a department does not preclude a person from being nominated.
Length of Service – Candidates must have completed three academic years of full-time professional
service within the nominating campus out of the previous five years in the position for which they are
nominated prior to the year of nomination.
Restrictions – Individuals serving in the classified services are ineligible for nomination (e.g., positions
paid on an hourly rather than salary basis are generally in the classified services).
Please note that for the Community Colleges, individuals serving as heads of divisions (frequently referred
to as Deans) may be nominated predicated on their fulfilling the eligibility and selection criteria. However,
for this sector, the title “Dean of Instruction” frequently refers to the individual who serves as the head
campus academic officer. Where this is the case, the individual may not be nominated.
Special Considerations for the Professional Service Award
Exclusively for the Excellence in Professional Service Award, nominations may be made by not-for-profit
agencies serving a State University function at one of the organizational units (e.g., the campus Research
Foundation offices, etc.) of the State University of New York. Any such nominations count toward the total
allocations permissible for the nominating campus. For the purposes of the Professional Service Award,
the State University System Administration is considered a campus. It may make one Professional Service
nomination drawn from the aggregate of eligible staff at the System Administration, the State University
Construction Fund, SUNY Charter Schools Institute, and the SUNY Research Foundation.
The Chancellor can make nominations for additional Professional Service Awards, from either a specific
campus, the State University System Administration, the State University Construction Fund, SUNY
Charter Schools Institute, or the SUNY Research Foundation provided the individual meets the eligibility
requirements.

EXCELLENCE IN SCHOLARSHIP AND CREATIVE ACTIVITIES (EISCA)
Nature of the Program – EISCA
The Chancellor’s Award for Excellence in Scholarship and Creative Activities supports the pursuits
foundational to sustaining the intellectual growth of SUNY institutions by recognizing consistently
outstanding scholarly and creative productivity, conducted in addition to teaching, by SUNY’s
instructional faculty.
Selection Criteria – EISCA
Evidence of sound scholarship (traditionally research and publication in the sciences, social sciences, and
humanities) and creative productivity (in fields where scholarship takes the form of artistic production,
performance, composition, etc.) can be demonstrated through a variety of avenues, including grants,
6

release time, honors, etc. The selection criteria for this award shall include a reasonable combination of,
but not be restricted to, those appearing below. Nominees should be individuals who have:
For Scholarship (research in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities) – An excellent,
sustained record of research publications in peer-reviewed journals, and/or research monographs,
and/or research-oriented texts; or a record of presenting at national and/or international
conferences, presentation of papers published in conference proceedings and/or digests, patents
awarded, grants secured, and citation of work by individuals or groups other than the nominee’s
collaborators.
For Creative Productivity (generally the fine or performing arts or those fields where
creative productivity constitutes scholarship e.g., culinary arts, etc.) – A record of excellence
in creative activity appropriate for the specific field or discipline, such as exhibitions, shows,
performances, productions, and stage work; or a record demonstrating evidence of critical reviews,
grants, inclusion of works in permanent collections, retrospectives, and other forms of external
recognition and acclaim.
Eligibility Criteria – EISCA
Academic Background – Candidates must be tenured, tenure-track, or full-time non-tenure track faculty
for the academic year in which the award is to be given, and regularly carry a full-time teaching load as
defined by the campus for full-time teaching. (Note: Please see full discussion of this issue above
under “Academic Background” section for the Excellence in Faculty Service award.)
Academic Rank – Candidates may hold any full-time academic rank as defined in the SUNY Board of
Trustees policies: professor, associate professor, assistant professor, instructor, assistant instructor, or
clinical professor. Please note the State University of New York Policies of the Board of Trustees –
April 2017 – Article II - §1 (Terms).

EXCELLENCE IN TEACHING (EIT)
Nature of the Program – EIT
The Chancellor’s Award for Excellence in Teaching recognizes consistently superior teaching at the
graduate, undergraduate, or professional level in keeping with the State University’s commitment to
providing its students with instruction of the highest quality.
Selection Criteria – EIT
The primary criterion is skill in teaching. Additionally, consideration is also given to sound scholarship
(usually demonstrated through publications or artistic productions), outstanding service to students, as well
as service to the State University and to the campus. The following criteria are to be used in selecting
nominees for this award:
Teaching Techniques and Representative Materials – There must be positive evidence that the
candidate performs superbly in the classroom. The nominee must maintain a flexible instructional
7

policy that adapts readily to student needs, interests and problems. Mastery of teaching
techniques must be demonstrated and substantiated. Consideration is to be given to the number
of substantially different courses taught, the number of students per course, and the different
teaching techniques employed in the various courses.
Student evaluations (in the form of student questionnaires administered and compiled by persons
other than the nominee) should be presented for several different courses over a period of several
recent years to provide a clear idea of the nominee's impact on students.
Scholarship and Professional Growth – Candidates must be teacher/scholars who keep abreast
of their own field and who use the relevant contemporary data from that field and related disciplines
in their teaching. Evidence in this area includes, but is not limited to, publications, grants,
presentations at conferences, artistic productions, etc.
Student Services – In relating to students, candidates must be generous with personal time,
easily accessible, and must demonstrate a continual concern for the intellectual growth of
individual students. The focus here is the accessibility of the nominee to students outside of class
(e.g., office hours, conferences, special meetings, and the nominee's responsibility in terms of
student advisement).
Academic Standards and Requirements, and Evaluation of Student Performance –
Candidates must set high standards for students and help them attain academic excellence.
Quantity and quality of work that is more than average for the subject must be required of
the students. Candidates must work actively with individual students to help them improve their
scholarly or artistic performance. This individual interaction is an important source of information
that indicates the nature and level of instruction offered by the nominee. Consideration is to be
given to the quality, quantity, and difficulty of the tasks or work assigned to students.
Candidates' evaluations of students' work must be strongly supported by evidence. Candidates must be
willing to give greater weight to each student's final level of competence than to the performance at the
beginning of the course. Since expert teachers enable students to achieve high levels of scholarship, it is
possible that the candidates' marking records may be somewhat above average. But there must also be
evidence that candidates do not hesitate to give low evaluations to students who do poorly. For this
category, consideration should be given to grading patterns, particularly grade distributions for all courses
in at least two recent years. Evidence in support of student performance may also be assessed by the
accomplishments of students, including placement and achievement levels.
Eligibility Criteria - EIT
Academic Background – Candidates must be tenured, tenure-track, or full-time non-tenure track faculty
for the academic year in which the award is to be given, and regularly carry a full-time teaching load as
defined by the campus for full-time teaching. (Note: Please see full discussion of this issue above
under “Academic Background” section for the Excellence in Faculty Service award.)
Academic Rank – Candidates may hold any full-time academic rank as defined in the SUNY Board of
Trustees policies: professor, associate professor, assistant professor, instructor, assistant instructor, or
8

clinical professor. Please note the State University of New York Policies of the Board of Trustees –
April 2017 – Article II - §1 (Terms).
Length of Service – Candidates must have completed three academic years of full-time teaching at the
nominating campus out of the five years on the nominating campus immediately prior to the year of
nomination.

SELECTION PROCESSES FOR ALL PROGRAMS
These programs require campuses to empanel a specifically-constituted committee to elicit nominations,
evaluate candidates, and recommend to the campus President the candidates to forward to the System
Administration level. The following describes the overarching and program-specific requirements. Under
no circumstance may individuals apply – or self-nominate – for these awards.
CAMPUS NOMINATION PROCESS
The programs require that nominations coming forward to the System Administration level be the product of
an objective and rigorous campus review. Further, the nomination process should benefit from the
involvement of a broad spectrum of the campus community including the faculty, the student body and
administration. The program-specific nomination requirements follow:
LOCAL SELECTION COMMITTEE
As noted above, the awards require the establishment of a committee specifically charged with selecting
the campus’s nominees.
Committee Appointment and Structure – The campus selection committees for these awards shall be
appointed by the campus governance structure (as is currently done by each campus for appointment of
other faculty committees) with the concurrence of the campus President. The committee shall include the
chair (or chair’s designee) of the campus faculty governance organization; one member, designated by the
campus President, to act in an ex officio capacity; and faculty and student representation. In addition to
this common structure, each award requires its committee to include:
For Faculty Service – none beyond the common structure prescribed above;
Scholarship and Creative Activities – none beyond the common structure prescribed above;
For Librarianship – library faculty and staff;
For Professional Service – a minimum of 50 percent professional service personnel (i.e., who are
employed in capacities that are eligible for the award); and
For Teaching – full-time faculty.
Committee Role – The local selection committee solicits nominations; conducts an objective and rigorous
evaluation of the merits of candidates nominated; recommends to the campus President nominees to go
9

forward to the System Administration level; and prepares the final nomination portfolio. Consequently,
nominations received at the System Administration level should represent the campus’s finest exemplars of
the qualities recognized through these awards.
The primary evaluation of the nominee's qualifications is the responsibility of the campus. The
campus selection committee must determine that its candidates meets, and preferably surpasses, each
selection criteria for the award for which nominated. The local selection committee determines the
approaches the campus will utilize to solicit nominations (e.g., bulletins, campus newspapers, e-mails,
listservs, etc.). It also determines the type of supporting evidence the committee will need to conduct its
evaluations of candidate merit (e.g., the number and source of letters of recommendations, types of
samples of the nominees’ work, attending the nominee’s classes, etc.) and the process for selecting
candidates to forward to System Administration.
The Scholarship and Creative Activities award requires that external peer evaluations (from
impartial referees from the nominee’s discipline) are to be included in the campus nominating
process. These evaluations should be referenced, but not included, in the Summary Presentations
prepared for the candidates’ nomination portfolios.
The campus selection committee shall make its report in the form of a recommendation to the campus
President, and shall forward to the campus President no more than the allocated number of nominations.
Nominations endorsed by the campus President shall be forwarded to the Program Manager for Faculty
and Staff Awards, Office of the Senior Vice Chancellor and Provost at System Administration.
Note: The campus process may be more extensive and its requirements more stringent than the
requirements outlined in these program guidelines. They may not be less rigorous than the program
requirements.
Confidentiality
Selection for an Excellence Award is an event of great joy and pride for the recipient and the campus.
Conversely, non-selection generates enormous disappointment. The sensitivities inherent in such
recognition programs and the nature of the supporting documentation involved make it imperative
that all deliberations of the campus committee remain strictly confidential.
Because of the confidentiality of these proceedings, the System-level Program Manager of these
awards will interact only with the campus President, campus chief academic officer, or the
President’s designee.

10

NOMINATION PORTFOLIO
The campus selection committee is responsible for preparing the nomination portfolio submitted to System
Administration. For each nominee, the campus must submit one original hard copy (additional copies
aren’t necessary). It must be collated in the order presented below and must include the following:
Checklist Cover Sheet – This form must be the first sheet of the nominee's portfolio. It is used to
ensure compliance with program policies and procedures and for administrative purposes. The form is
appended to these guidelines. The Checklist contains the certifications regarding the candidate's eligibility
and campus compliance with the program policies and procedures. The campus President must sign
the Checklist. Nominations received without this endorsement will be disqualified.
Transmittal Letter – A brief transmittal letter addressing how the candidate meets the selection criteria
is required from the campus President. This letter should reflect the campus’s rationale for making the
nomination and speak succinctly to the candidate’s merit. The letter should be addressed to the
State University Provost, State University of New York, System Administration, State University
Plaza, 353 Broadway, Albany, New York 12246-2915. A separate letter is to accompany each
nomination.
Nomination Procedures – A brief explanation is required that describes the mechanism by which
nominations were solicited, what evidence was examined by the local selection committee in the
evaluation of nominees, and how the local committee arrived at its selection.
Summary Presentation – The Summary Presentation provides the rationale for the campus’s
nomination of a particular candidate and sets forth candidate merit for selection. It should reflect the
committee’s objectivity and impartiality in coming to its decision in what is generally a highly competitive
campus process. It is limited to five pages, excluding the cover page.
The Summary Presentation is the primary documentation available to those involved in the System-level
review to explain the campus' rationale for nominating the candidate for this honor. It must address
how the candidate excels in each criterion for selection for the award to which the candidate is
nominated (e.g., if there are three selection criteria, then candidate’s performance in each must be
described) as well as the candidate's most outstanding qualifications and major achievements. The
quality of the evidence provided is critical to recommendation. Although excerpts from the
recommendations can and should be included, the Summary Presentation must be more than a
testimonial. There must be specific, concrete examples of how the nominee fulfills each criterion.
Summary Presentations should not be written by the nominee (or in first person) because this
undermines the impartiality and objectivity required of the nomination process. The Summary
Presentation is limited to a maximum of five pages, excluding the cover sheet.
□ Current Curriculum Vita (CV) – An up-to-date and moderately detailed CV containing information on
the nominee's career must be included in the nomination portfolio. Specific data must include the date
of appointment to the SUNY system, highest rank attained and date of appointment to that rank.
It should also include areas of specialization, research activities, professional and scholarly publications,
honors, and campus and State University service.
11

Note: None of the nominating documentation will be returned to the campus. We aren’t able to
accept electronic nomination submissions via e-mail at this time.

SUBMISSION
Forwarding Address – The original of the nomination portfolios are to be sent to (no additional copies
required):
Ms. Yvette Roberts, Program Manager for Faculty and Staff Awards
State University of New York, System Administration
Office of the Senior Vice Chancellor and Provost
State University Plaza, Room S525
Albany, New York 12246-2915
Deadline – To facilitate the nomination process on campuses, the deadline for the current and subsequent
program cycles are being provided. All nomination portfolios must be received by the Program
Manager on or before the third Tuesday in February:
Tuesday, February 19, 2019 for Academic Year 2018-2019
Tuesday, February 18, 2020 for Academic Year 2019-2020

REVIEW BY SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION
Each nomination will be reviewed for compliance with the SUNY-wide criteria for selection and eligibility.
Each nominee’s portfolio will be examined to confirm the individual’s eligibility and to ensure that the
portfolio contains substantive evidence (as opposed to testimonials) in support of each selection
criterion for the particular award. This evidence is critical to recommendation. Omission can lead (and
has led) to non-recommendation of candidates.
Where a candidate is not being recommended for selection, the campus President, campus chief academic
officer, or the President’s designee will be contacted confidentially and offered the option of providing the
information sought by reviewers or of withdrawing the nomination. Contact with the campus President will
be made prior to making award recommendations to the Chancellor.
After review, nominees supported for this honor will have their name forwarded to the Chancellor through
the Office of the Senior Vice Chancellor and Provost at System Administration. Selection is contingent
upon approval of recommendations by the Chancellor. SUNY Board of Trustees action is not involved
in the Excellence Awards process.
Failure by a campus to comply with the procedures established for the selection of nominees will
result in the disqualification of all nominees from that institution.

12

SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION
The nominations will be evaluated at the SUNY-wide level and award announcements will be made
by late April.
Informal notification occurs via e-mail to the campus President once approval of recommendations has
been received from the Chancellor. Formal notification is done by letter from the Chancellor to the recipient
with a copy to the campus President. The recipient’s original award letter, certificate and medallion will be
mailed to the campus President for presentation to the recipient. It is more efficient to handle in this
manner for those campuses that wish to present recipients with their award during commencement, at
academic convocations, or at special event in honor of their selection.
These guidelines are also available online at the Office of the Senior Vice Chancellor and Provost and can
be accessed at: http://system.suny.edu/academic-affairs/faculty-staff-awards/.

AWARD FOR WHICH SUBMITTED
A Summary Presentation must be completed for each nomination submitted for the Chancellor’s Awards for
Excellence in Faculty Service, Librarianship, Professional Service, Scholarship and Creative Activities, and
Teaching.
This is the primary documentation available to reviewers at the System-wide level explaining the rationale
for the candidate’s nomination for award, and forms the basis for the review at the University-wide level.
Most importantly, the Summary Presentation must provide specific evidence of how the nominee excels in
each selection criterion for the program for which the individual is being nominated. It should also highlight
the nominee’s most outstanding achievements. The Summary Presentation is limited to a maximum of five
pages, excluding the cover page.
This form is also available online at:
