 Check one.

[  X  ]     This proposal is for a multi-award program  that  leads  to  two
      separate awards  (e.g.,  A.S./B.A.,  B.S./M.S.).   Complete  Part  2A,
      below.    NOTE:  Such programs generally  involve  special  admissions
      for students who have the capacity to complete all awards,  curricular
      integration between the component  programs,  and  shortened  time  to
      degree compared to taking the programs separately.

 [    ]     This proposal is for a multi-institution program (also called  a
      “jointly registered program”) to be offered jointly  by  two  or  more
      institutions.  Complete Part B, below.   NOTE:  Such programs  involve
      a formal agreement between two or more institutions to  offer  courses
      leading to an award.

[    ]      This proposal is for a  multi-institution,  multi-award  program

b) Program Awards ((e.g., B.A./M.S.) from existing  programs):  Bachelor  of
   Arts in English/ M.A.T. in English Adolescence Education

c) Proposed HEGIS Code: 2205.00

d) Required Number of Credits:  Minimum    [  156     ]       If  tracks  or
   options, largest minimum [      ]

e) Format:  [ X ] Day    [ X ] Evening  [  ] Weekend     [  ]
   Evening/Weekend     [  ] Not Full-Time

f) Mode:    [X  ] Standard   [  ] Independent Study   [  ] External   [  ]
   Accelerated

      [  ]  Distance Education  (If 50% of more of the program can be
   completed via distance education,

      append a Distance Education Format Proposal at the end of this form.)



g)   Other:    [  ] Bilingual  [  ] Language Other Than English   [  ]
   Upper Division Program   [  ] Cooperative

   4.5 year    [ X ] 5 year

h)    List registered programs at the institution identified  in  Section  1
   whose courses will contribute to this program.  Add rows as needed.

|         |English Adolescence Education    |          |                 |


i) List all the courses required for each  existing  program,  and  indicate
   which ones will be counted toward both awards. See attachment 1
j) How long will it take for full-time students  to  complete  the  proposed
   program? 5 years
k) What are the admissions requirements for the new  program,  and  how  are
   they related to student success?
      Candidates must apply for the program by the end of Junior year. They
      must have 12 credits of residency.  All candidates must show a GPA of
      3.25 overall and 3.25 in the courses required for the English B.A.
      degree.  An interview is required.
      Transfer students ‘GPA must meet Old Westbury’s GPA requirements and
      transfer courses must be calculated along with Old Westbury grades for
      admission to this program.


      Candidates must submit an application that includes
       • An essay
       • GRE scores
       • Two letters of reference from faculty
       • All college transcripts


      Highly qualified candidates will complete the program in five years by
      accelerating undergraduate coursework, and moving on to graduate study
      in the fourth year.   Candidates must maintain a GPA of 3.25 (overall
      and in the major) in each semester of study.  Additionally, no grades
      of D are permitted for any required courses, and candidates must meet
      requirements of the English major. These include a maximum of one
      grade of C- in English content courses.  Those whose GPA falls below
      3.25 will be placed on probation and will have one semester to bring
      up their grades.    Candidates who fail to complete the five-year
      program will be administratively transferred into the English major,
      and will graduate with the B.A. degree.


l) Complete a SUNY Sample Program Schedule to  show  how  students  will  be
   able to  schedule  all  required  courses  to  complete  the  multi-award
   program.
