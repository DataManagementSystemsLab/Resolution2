TELLING OUR STORY OF

STUDENT LEARNING THROUGH
MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT
ASHLEY FINLEY, Ph.D
Vice President For Research & Senior Advisor To The President
AAC&U
A great many institutional resources, including human resources, are expended on assessment without
enough discussion of intent. Assessment, effectively employed, tells a holistic story about student
learning and success - across the college journey, not just in one course or one program. But effective
storytelling takes planning, a sense of audience, and solid communication. In short, the best stories
require asking meaningful questions about what matters and what’s next. The goal for this discussion is
for participants to consider assessment as a means to a strategic end for students’ learning and
development across the curriculum that invites dialogue among faculty, staff, and even students.
Participants will be invited to reflect upon how their own and institutional commitments to equity,
learning, and success can be leveraged through collaboration to reach shared goals for improvement.
