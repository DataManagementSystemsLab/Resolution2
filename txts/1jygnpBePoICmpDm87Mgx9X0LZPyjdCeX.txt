| Program Description, Purposes and Planning                                          |


   a) What is the description of the program as it will appear in the
      institution’s catalog?


The Modern Languages Department bilingual B.A. Degree in Hispanic and Latin-
American Cultural Studies proposes to offer both innovation and rigor in a
field of academic research, which has grown considerably in importance and
relevance. The bilingual nature of the proposed program of study, as well
as its trans-disciplinary organization, make it equally pertinent and
suitable to a large spectrum of students, with varied cultural and ethnic
backgrounds.

In contrast with the other major offered by the Department, this degree
focuses on the exploration of culture, its meaning, interpretation and
critique. It aims to prepare students who plan to seek employment in
government, social services or political and human rights organizations, as
well as those who intend to enter graduate school.

Students seeking this B.A. can choose between two clearly defined options.
Option One is bilingual and entails mastery of the Spanish language. Option
Two is designed for students seeking to complete the degree in English. In
both options, students are introduced to three interconnected academic
disciplines: Hispanism, Latin American Cultural Studies and Decolonial
Theory. The structure of the degree reflects a progress from development of
linguistic skills, in the Core Courses, to introduction to area studies and
exploration of specific fields or perspectives, in the Major Requirements,
to the capstone course on Methods of Research and Analysis in Cultural
Studies.


b)  What are the program’s educational and, if appropriate, career
objectives, and the program’s primary student learning outcomes (SLOs)?
NOTE:  SLOs are defined by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education
in the Characteristics of Excellence in Higher Education as “clearly
articulated written statements, expressed in observable terms, of key
learning outcomes: the knowledge, skills and competencies that students are
expected to exhibit upon completion of the program.”

    • Students will understand the theoretical foundations of Cultural
      Studies and how they are applied to the understanding of ethnic
      studies in general and Spanish, Latin-American, and Latino Studies in
      particular.
    • Students will demonstrate knowledge of the Spanish speaking world’s
      linguistic diversity through the comprehension of Spanish in a variety
      of situations, discursive modes and historical, regional or social
      variations.
    • Students will interpret, understand and engage literary and art works
      within cultural, social, and historical contexts.
    • Students will demonstrate cultural awareness with respect to the
      diversity of cultural products and manifestations produced in the
      Spanish speaking world: Spain, Latin America, the United States and
      other countries in which there is a cultural production in Spanish.
    • Students will have a deep understanding of indigenous cultures and
      movements in Latin America, understanding them within the current
      local and global sociopolitical contexts.
    • Students will achieve a working knowledge of Decolonial Theory trends
      to analyze, describe, and criticize Hispanic cultural representations
      and historical interpretations.

c) How does the program relate to the institution’s and SUNY’s mission and
strategic goals and priorities?  What is the program’s importance to the
institution, and its relationship to existing and/or projected programs and
its expected impact on them?  As applicable, how does the program reflect
diversity and/or international perspectives?

The proposed BA degree in Hispanic and Latin-American Cultural Studies will
uphold all aspects of Old Westburyʼs mission.

It will foster academic excellence and stimulate a passion for learning
through a rigorous program of study, which will include interdisciplinary
approaches to language, literature, cinema and popular culture, and will
stress research activities.

It will weave the values of integrity, community engagement and global
citizenship into its curriculum as its main purpose is to study cultural
phenomena of the Hispanic world from a post- colonial perspective, and as
one component will be an internship in the Hispanic community.

It will cultivate both critical thinking and creativity by considering
Hispanism and Hispanic Studies, not as a defined and closed discipline, but
as an open and controversial area of study.

Intercultural understanding is obviously the basic goal of such a degree,
with its bilingual structure. Through their examination of the dynamics of
cultural production in our societies, students will be encouraged to
envision, and inspired to contribute to building, a more just and
sustainable world.



d)  How were faculty involved in the program’s design, and describe input
by external partners, if any (e.g., employers and institutions offering
further education?

The impetus for the program dates to the 5-Year Review, which was completed
in the AY 2011-2012, in which both Modern Language Faculty and the outside
evaluators concurred on the need to expand the Department’s curriculum to
accommodate the ever growing need to design rigorous study of Hispanic
cultural studies.


To cite Ana Maria Hernandez,
In view of the rapid growth of the Spanish-speaking population both in the
United States, and worldwide, and the resultant global impact of Latin
American culture and language on the arts and commerce, it is essential
that the modern language department devote the majority of our course
offerings to support the Spanish Major.


In response to the demand for a cultural studies curriculum, in the fall of
2012, Department Chair, Dr. Zeniada Madurka, together with Dr. Fernando
Guerrero launched a department-wide initiative to develop the program as a
separate Bachelor’s Degree that would enhance the department’s major in
Spanish Language, Hispanic Literature and Culture by attracting students
from throughout the College interested in pursuing careers in arts and
commerce and graduate education that require a sensitivity to the Hispanic
cultures of New York City apart from the teacher education track for those
who want to pursue careers other that teaching.

The proposed program fills two needs according to current trends in
undergraduate education:  first, it allows students to complete their
studies in Hispanic culture although they may not possess an advanced level
command of Spanish.  The proposed major would afford the option of
completing the upper level courses in English with the requirement of as
little as one semester of Spanish at the intermediate level.  And second,
it shifts the emphasis of the humanities degree to provide more
commercially marketable training to cultural studies, which student demand
has shown in preference to the degree in literature.

During the fall of 2012 and spring of 2013, the Modern Language faculty
worked together to determine the curriculum of the proposed major.  We
agreed that most of the courses currently taught in the Modern Languages
Department would fulfill the requirements for the major, with only four or
five new courses necessary to complement the cultural studies component.
But, in order to expand our outreach, the Department worked out an
interdisciplinary curriculum that included courses taught in English that
would bring the Hispanic cultural studies major to students who lack
sufficient Spanish language and written expression skills to succeed in a
Spanish-only program.

To this end, during the spring of 2013, the Modern Languages Department
requested a new faculty line in Hispanic Cultural Studies. With the
retirement of Distinguished Teaching Professor, Jesse Fernandez (Spring
2013), which coincided with Dr. Ruben Gonzalez’ return to teaching with the
Modern Languages department, Department faculty agreed that the candidate
for the position should be a specialist in Hispanic Cultural Studies.  The
Modern Language Department hired Dr. Angel Lara on a one-year visiting
contract in the AY 2013-14 and was hired full-time as Assistant Professor
of Hispanic Cultural Studies effective Fall 2014.

The faculty collaborated to work out the curriculum for the major to
include recommendations of Dr. Lara to bring courses related to digital
media studies into the curriculum. (See below).

Dr. Sonia Assa teaches:  ML3200 Translation Workshop; ML 4750 Fiction into
Film ML3500 Critical Writing, ML 4750 Fiction into Film and ML4510
Civilizations and Cultures of Spain.

Dr. Ruben Gonzalez: In addition to the courses that make up the existing
core and elective courses, Dr. Gonzalez HI3210 Hispanic Heritage (in
English), Ml3401 Latino Writers in the US (in English) as well as ML3362
Advanced Grammar and Composition

Dr. Fernando Guerrero: In addition to the core courses and literature
electives, Dr. Guerrero teaches ML4510 Civilization and Culture of Spain,
ML3300 Artistic Expressions of Spain (Study Abroad course)

Dr. Angel Lara: Dr. Lara comes to the Department with a wealth of knowledge
of the Cultural Studies curriculum.  He has already taught three of the
courses that he has proposed for the curriculum since his arrival in the
Fall of 2013.  These include the 2 courses:  ML2550 Intro to Hispanic
Cultural Studies (in English); and ML2500 Hispanic Language and Culture,
which can serve as the intermediate course for those wishing to complete
the program predominantly in English.  He has also taught ML3310 Topics in
Chicana/o Cultural Studies.  And he developed courses in ML3310 Topics in
Decolonial Theory, ML3510 Creative Writing and ML3500 Fiction Writing for
Spanish Television.

Dr. Zenaida Madurka:  In addition to the core courses and major electives,
Dr. Madurka teaches ML3650 Latin American and Peninsular Cinema; ML4545
Civilization and Culture of Latin America. She has also developed and
taught ML3300 Artistic Expressions of Spain as a study abroad course taught
during the summer.

Dr. Kathleen O’Connor-Bater.  In addition to the core courses and electives
from the present curriucla, Dr. O’Connor-Bater will teach the ML 3310
Topics in Sociolinguistics in conjunction with a COIL partnership with the
Instituto Tecnologico de Monterrery (Campus Chihuahua) in the Spring of
2016.  She also teaches HI3110 Latin American Cultures (in English), ML4630
Latin American Literature (in English) and ML3800 Masterpieces of Hispanic
Literature (in English). She is currently adapting the course ML4800
Modernisms and Modernity, whose focus has traditionally been one of
literature, into a course in cultural studies and literature in which
various critical, artistic, and commercial expressions of modernity are
explored.



e)  How did input, if any, from external partners (e.g., educational
institutions and employers) or standards influence the program’s design?
If the program is designed to meet specialized accreditation or other
external standards, such as the educational requirements in Commissioner’s
Regulations for the profession, append a side-by-side chart to show how the
program’s components meet those external standards.  If SED’s Office of the
Professions requires a specialized form for the profession to which the
proposed program leads, append a completed form at the end of this
document.

f)  Enter anticipated enrollments for Years 1 through 5 in the table below.
 How were they determined, and what assumptions were used?  What
contingencies exist if anticipated enrollments are not achieved?

Estimated FTE = FT headcount + PT headcount/3.  This formula is a standard
formula used in IPEDS reporting (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data
System) by the National Center for Education Statistics, which has been
adopted by SUNY.

h)  Program Impact on SUNY and New York State

h)(1)       Need: What is the need for the proposed program in terms of the
      clientele it will serve and the educational and/or economic needs of
      the area and New York State?  How was need determined?  Why are
      similar programs, if any, not meeting the need?

As described in section 2.3-a, the new B.A. degree in Hispanic and Latin-
American Cultural Studies was developed as a response to a demographic
reality and to the relevance of Spanish language and Latino cultures in the
socio-cultural life of the United States. In our campus, the percentage of
Hispanic students has grown significantly. However, the bilingual and trans-
disciplinary nature of the proposed program make it equally pertinent and
suitable to a large spectrum of students.
The new B.A. degree in Hispanic and Latin-American Cultural Studies
understands culture as one of the most complicated words in any language.
Therefore the new degree responds to the need of exploring Latino, Hispanic
and Latin American cultures by demystifying and extending the meaning of
the word “culture” beyond a “canon” of great works of art and literature.
Our proposed program will abandon the traditional split between high and
low culture that opposes serious art to popular or mass culture; it will
substitute the vertical relationship (high/low) with a horizontal one; it
will recognize that nowadays not only culture but scholars and students are
subject to market pressures (our subjectivity is being rehearsed and
reinvent in this process); it will approach the topic of media in all its
historical, technical and theoretical complexity; it will abandon the idea
of culture as avant-garde and that elite culture will play a role in
political and social transformation (humanistic discourse), and it will
look instead how mass culture and cultural practices link to political and
economic discourses in specific instances.
Further, the degree in Hispanic and Latin-American Cultural Studies
responds to the desire expressed by our students on numerous occasions, to
be offered a curriculum which would reflect the way they experience and
consume culture(s) and would also provide them with a set of tools and
skills to interpret culture(s) within our global economic system.

   |2.5.  Academic and Other Support Services                                           |


Summarize the academic advising and support services available to help
students succeed in the program.
Each Hispanic and Latin American Cultural Studies major will have a full
time faculty advisor who will be responsible for coordinating program
requirements. Academic advising is an essential component of each of the
Modern Languages department programs.  The advisor will serve as a primary
source of information and support during the students’ tenure in the
program. The advisor serves as a mentor in relation to career planning,
plans for future study, academic progress and other issues that impact
students’ performance in the program. Majors will be expected to meet
regularly with advisors during each semester. Such meetings will provide
opportunities for both in-depth discussion of personal experiences,
including the application of theory to practice and the implications of
research methods and analysis in cultural studies.

All students have access to the full range of services provided by the
college. The Center for Academic Advising, for example, assists students in
understanding and meeting the College's academic requirements for
graduation.  Whenever necessary, the staff explains the General Education
curriculum to students.  They also assist with online degree evaluation,
particularly to transfer students who need to understand how their previous
coursework has been evaluated.

The department of Modern Languages is located in a new 147,000 square feet
academic building. The Computing Services Division, located in this
building, provides all campus-wide technology services in terms of
installation, maintenance and upgrade of hardware and software.  All majors
are issued e-mail accounts and server space to store data and files on the
campus network.  Similarly, faculty members are issued email accounts and
server space to store data and files that can be shared at will on the
campus network.

The college houses a Writing Center where assistance and non-credit
workshops are provided to students.  Services at the Writing Center have
been particularly beneficial to some Modern Languages Majors whose first
language is not English and who take literature and history courses offered
in English.  On-line tutoring is also available for any student who might
need help with writing assignments.

A dedicated computer lab for language study is available for all students
taking courses within the department programs.  The lab is heavily used by
students taking language courses, as most of these courses require lab
attendance and lab work.

Every semester three or four seniors majoring in Modern Languages volunteer
to tutor other students who may need help with aspects of Spanish grammar
or the content of a particular course.  Tutoring services within the
department are coordinated by the Chairperson and the department’s
secretary.

The department of Modern Languages participates in the SUNY Learning
Network (SLN).  Faculty teaching online courses participate in a series of
workshops run by the SLN in the semester before their first offering. In
the spring of 2010 the college launched a “hybrid initiative” to foster the
development of courses combining online and classroom instruction.  The
following year online only courses were added to this initiative. Faculty
developing online and hybrid courses receive a stipend for course
development.  In addition to support offered by the SLN, the staff of the
Student Computing Center supports online as well as computer lab-based
instruction via a help desk overseen by two lab managers, who also run
faculty development workshops on Blackboard, work with faculty one-on-one
to help them develop online course components in Blackboard, and create and
disseminate “how-to” instructions on Blackboard.  The Online Initiative is
run by a faculty member who serves as Director of Distance Learning.  The
department of Modern Languages offers about five online courses per
semester and will increase that number with the addition of the bachelor in
Hispanic and Latin American Cultural Studies.

Descriptions of new courses:
ML2550 Intro to Spanish, Latin American and Latino Cultural Studies
This course aims at three culminating goals: development of critical
thinking and interdisciplinarity, deconstruction of preconceptions about
culture, power, and social relations applied to Spanish, Latin-American,
and Latino cultures. We will study the presence of Spanish and Latin-
American cultures, as well as the influence they have had, across their
national homelands and on a global scale. Through lectures, discussion,
practical research and writing, class members will critically investigate
the varied dimensions of Spanish, Latin American, and Latino cultures,
learning to understand them in their broader social, cultural, ethical and
political contexts. Students will examine the effect that social and
cultural models associated with colonialism, nation building, and Western
modernity have had on the formation and development of Spanish, Latin-
American, and Latino identities and cultures. This course will also provide
students with a basic theoretical and methodological toolbox for
problematizing Hispanism as both an academic discipline and a power
mechanism.

ML3310 Topics in Chicana/o Cultural Studies
This course serves as an introduction to the field of Chicana/o Cultural
Studies. Students will be guided into developing an understanding of the
historical development of Chicanas/os, their Mesoamerican roots, cultural
identification, political activities, and contemporary roles and influence
in United States culture, society and economy. A substantial part of the
course is dedicated to the study of Chicano art, its major influences,
themes and styles, from its emergence in the 1960s to the present time. We
will examine the historical, social and cultural context of the Chicano/a
art movement and the major forces that shape artistic creation in this
field. We will also study Chicana feminist scholarship and cultural
representations, border issues, resistance to patriarchy, and Chicanas’
search for empowerment.


ML3--- Introduction to Decolonial Thinking
The primary aim of this course is to give students an introduction to the
growing body of thought coming out of Latin America under the heading of
Decolonial Theory. Decolonial thinking focuses on understanding modernity
in the context of a form of critical reasoning applied to cultural studies,
by confronting, and delinking from, the dominant epistemologies and world
views applied to the study and understanding of reality. Key words and
concepts in this course include: Coloniality; Geopolitics of knowledge;
Colonial globality and global designs; Border theory; Modernity and
Transmodernity; Indigenous cultures and movements in Latin America.

ML3-- Spanish Sociolinguistics
Spanish Sociolinguistics: (Course taught in Spanish) In this course we will
examine all aspects of Spanish language variation worldwide with a
particular view to topics of both “emic” and “etic” language variation.
Topics to be considered include attitudes towards language and dialect,
standard language and language change, gramaticalization, social
implications of age (aging), gender, class; regional variation by language
in contact with English, Portuguese, Catalan; regional variation by contact
with Indigenous languages: Quechua, Guaraní and Mexican Languages; Spanish
speakers and language variation in United States Spanish; and language
planning and language policy.  All of these topics are to be examined
through the lens of sociological considerations such as language and
identity, attitudes, bilingualism, historical linguistics and ideology.  

ML4--- Digital Media and Convergence Culture in the Spanish World
This course explores the relationships between media technologies,
institutions, cultural forms and audiences within contemporary convergence
culture in the Spanish world. We will examine how traditional forms of mass
media texts have been impacted by new technologies and how such shifts are
reconfiguring media audiences/consumers in Latin America, Spain and Latino
US. Emphasis will be placed on understanding how existing media
institutions and textual forms have changed within convergence culture in
ways that challenge and uphold existing structures of media ownership and
rethink questions of active audience engagement. Students will be exposed
to a variety of forms of mass media in Spanish that emerged as a result of
such convergence. They will acquire familiarity with digital culture and
new media narratives so that they may become active and critically aware
participants and producers of media and cultural contents and practices
within the Spanish world.

|Section 7.  External Evaluation                                                 |


SUNY requires external evaluation of all proposed bachelor’s degree
programs, and may request an evaluation for a proposed associate degree or
certificate program in a new or emerging field or for other reasons.

Is an external evaluation required?   [   ] No   [   ] Yes

If yes, list below all SUNY-approved evaluators who conducted evaluations
(adding rows as needed), and submit a separate electronic document to
accompany this form that contains each original, signed External Evaluation
Report as well as the single Institutional Response to all reports, as
described in Section 8.  NOTE:  To select external evaluators, a campus
sends 3-5 proposed evaluators’ names, titles and CVs to the assigned SUNY
Program Reviewer, expresses its preferences and requests approval.

|Evaluator #1                        |Evaluator #2                        |
|Name:                               |Name:                               |
|Title:                              |Title:                              |

|Section 8.  Institutional Response to External Evaluator Reports            |


As applicable, send a single Institutional Response to all External
Evaluation Reports in the same file that contains the verbatim, signed
External Evaluation Reports.



   |Section 9.  SUNY Undergraduate Transfer                                         |


The State University views as one of its highest priorities the
facilitation of transfer.

a) For a proposed Associate in Arts (A.A.) or an Associate in Science
   (A.S.) degree, demonstrate that the program’s graduates will be able to
   transfer into at least two parallel SUNY baccalaureate programs and
   complete them within two additional years of full-time study, per SUNY
   policy, by listing the transfer institutions below and appending at the
   end of this document:
    –      two completed SUNY Transfer Course Equivalency Tables, one for
      each transfer institution; and
    –      a letter from the Chief Academic Officer of each transfer
      institution asserting acceptance of the completed Transfer Course
      Equivalency Table.
|Baccalaureate Degree         |Baccalaureate Program SED Code and|Degree   |
|Institution                  |Title                             |         |
|                             |                                  |         |
|                             |                                  |         |


b) For a proposed baccalaureate program, document articulation with at
   least two parallel SUNY associate degree programs for seamless transfer,
   by appending documentation of articulation, such as SUNY Transfer Course
   Equivalency Tables and/or letters of support from Chief Academic Officers
   at associate degree institutions or their designees.  If transfer does
   not apply to this program, please explain why.
|   Associate Degree          |Associate Program SED Code and    |Degree   |
|Institution                  |Title                             |         |
|                             |                                  |         |
|                             |                                  |         |


NOTE:  Transfer course equivalency tables are needed, despite SUNY Transfer
Paths, to ensure that all courses in an A.A. or A.S. program will be
accepted for transfer.  Official SED program titles and codes can be found
on NYSED’s Inventory of Registered Programs at
http://www.nysed.gov/heds/IRPSL1.html.

|Section 10.  Application for Distance Education                           |

a)  Does the program’s design enable students to complete 50% or more of
the course requirements through distance education?  [  ] No    [  ] Yes.
If yes, append a completed SUNY Distance Education Format Proposal at the
end of this proposal to apply for the program to be registered for the
distance education format.

b)  Does the program’s design enable students to complete 100% of the
course requirements through distance education?  [  ] No    [  ] Yes



|Section MPA-1.  Need for Master Plan Amendment and/or Degree Authorization   |


a) Based on Guidance on Master Plan Amendments, please indicate if this
   proposal requires a Master Plan Amendment.
   [  ] No     [  ] Yes, a completed Master Plan Amendment Form is appended
   at the end of this proposal.

b) Based on SUNY Guidance on Degree Authorizations (below), please indicate
   if this proposal requires degree authorization.


   [  ] No    [  ] Yes, once the program is approved by the SUNY Provost,
   the campus will work with its Campus Reviewer to draft a resolution that
   the SUNY Chancellor will recommend to the SUNY Board of Trustees.




   SUNY Guidance on Degree Authorization
   Degree authorization is required when a proposed program will lead to a
   new degree (e.g., B.F.A., M.P.H.) at an existing level of study (i.e.,
   associate, baccalaureate, first-professional, master’s, and doctoral) in
   an existing disciplinary area at an institution.  Disciplinary areas are
   defined by the New York State Taxonomy of Academic Programs.  Degree
   authorization requires approval by the SUNY Provost, the SUNY Board of
   Trustees and the Board of Regents.
