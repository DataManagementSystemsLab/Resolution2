Motion on Reappointment Case of Dr. Jane Weiss

Whereas,

The nonreappointment of Dr. Jane Weiss despite unanimous support in the former
English Language Studies Department for a one-year or two-year reappointment,

and unanimous support in the Appointment, Reappointment, Promotion and Tenure

Committee for a two-year reappointment, impermissibly violates faculty judgment
and the right of faculty to hire, evaluate, retain and promote its own members,

And whereas,

A violation of justice has occurred in that Dr. Weiss was not at any time warned of

possible dismissal or provided with a procedure for improving performance to avoid
dismissal,

Therefore, be it resolved,

The Senate urges reversal of the decision and retention of Dr. Weiss.
(Passed 18-0-0 by the Humanities and Languages Department, Sept. 10, 2004, for
submission to the Senate. Wording slightly revised to agree with the Senate’s “whereas”
style.)
