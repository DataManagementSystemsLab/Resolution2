Faculty Senate Chair Report

New ITGAC members and we will add a staff member (coordinated through UUP)

We are looking at bylaw revisions and there will be an official call for proposed changes to the bylaws

Later a town hall, then senate review 

President Performance Planning due Oct 20

There will be a workshop about the RFP and some faculty have already been directed to Lisandra to navigate the process 	

Presidential Committees are on the website 

He wants to reinvigorate spaces on campus, such as residence halls, develop more residences on campus (perhaps students and some faculty?)

EC has looked through all the committees to see where there is overlap with current faculty governance – we want Senate to know we’re trying to ensure that committees are represented 

Contact us if interested in representation 

President Sams: he wanted to set up new committees that would help to advance vision particularly for residential life and community-life on campus

He said that Senate Chair could talk with him at next meeting about this to see where there may be unintentional overlap or discuss if there are areas that could benefit from faculty input 

Oct 22: meeting to discuss ways to integrate the new program WEAVE for assessment

There is a new committee in the President’s priorities focused on assessment 

Reached out to School of Ed assessment

Waiting to see IEC’s preparation for Middle States’ response 		

Provost Report

11 days from now, there will be a site visit (Oct 19-20) from Advancing Quality and Educator Prep (AQEP)

Identify in communications ways to welcome visitors and supports efforts by School of Education for their accreditation assessment 

Quality assessment report is thorough and looking forward to visit 

President Sams and Provost Quarless visited the team and were both impressed with the team’s preparation, how they lead as educators and their work on this accreditation

In response to Middle States’ Commission report: there was an additional request for supplemental information report, due at the beginning of March to respond to the concerns that arose in the team’s review

Focused on academic assessment but also non-academic assessment

Courtney Raeford is leading efforts as co-chair of IEC, along with Dr. Robinson and Runi Mukherji

IEC and Mike Kavic are finalizing details to include outside consultant to help this group

in institutional response, acknowledged the need to possibly bring in outside consultant to   

Preparing for March 1 deadline and efforts

November 17th Common Hour: New Student Convocation

New details to follow 

Faculty representation requested – in regalia (if you need regalia, attend Mary Reilly) 

Identifying planning for supports that people have requested 

One institutional priority – continual improvement of electronic and information system technology accessibility

Ally tool indicates that much of the digital content created – while this supports learning outcomes, does not yet have accessibility rating of 100%

We’re at 63.4% accessibility 

Want the consultant to work with faculty – priority courses – and we’ll hear from Chandra to learn more about how to address the digital content 

E-catalog and course scheduler – automate the way we schedule courses, manage changes to minors and majors, and have those changes reflected across the electronic presence (catalog, Banner, web)

There is a 50% rule about degree programs (configured and registered with State DOE)

Only one program online

All others are face-to-face, traditional modality

We recognize after COVID-19, there needs to be more flexibility to meet needs of students but also to support continued outreach and range with regards to regional enrollment – expanding beyond just our region

Will continue to discuss with chairs about if/how to change – to change the current description of instructional delivery for degree programs, need to process through SUNY and State Education Department, and we need to navigate fiscal constraints 

Address department chairs’ requests for faculty request for sabbaticals     

We will support fiscally responsible way

Not all will be full-year at half pay	

We have a rubric

In context with regards to Middles States’ concerns about post-tenure review

Sabbatical should help support faculty development after 

As robust a fashion as possible

Deadlines for FUAC awards (Barb as administrator and President’s rep for FUAC)

Check deadlines and begin planning for student nominations for Chancellor’s award

Midterm grades due Oct 25th

Those are very important for helping us identify resource allocation to support student success (and prioritize around data from early alerts and midterm grades)	

Faculty spoke regarding positive COVID cases

Cabinet discussed this week: what would create threshold for notification 

Final language:

Should more than one case of COVID-19 present itself in an individual class section within a 5-7 day period, the instructor for that class and the administrative head of that respective school will be contacted.  The faculty member will be granted the option to move instruction to a remote setting for up to 10 days (the length of each remote period will be determined based on the dates governing the isolation of the most recent student case identified).  This remote option will be limited to that specific class section only.  Any additional actions will be determined in accordance with the contract tracing protocol that can be found in the campus' Fall '21 - COVID-19 Guidance (Section 5: When Infection or Violations Occur), https://www.oldwestbury.edu/covid#covidinfection. 

Contact tracing still determines what happens with regards to broader notifications

Martha Livingston: UUP will bring up issue with labor management issue – why does the case have to be more than one?

UUP Report

Martha Livingston: first time in 2 years that UUP hosts picnic till 3:30 

Meeting with administration about labor-management issues (issue of positive case notification) 

This shouldn’t be a question of proximity

We don’t need to know who in infected but that someone is infected so instructors can make a decision about going online

Arbitrarily 2 or more cases seems problematic 

Professionals have issues with being in person and keeping on masks 

Discussion about efficacy telecommuting – are there environmental benefits and productivity for some
