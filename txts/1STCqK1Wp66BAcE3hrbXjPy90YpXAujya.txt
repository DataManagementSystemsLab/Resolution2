Resolution to maintain the Ad Hoc faculty and staff committee to Promote Anti-Racist Initiatives This Year (PARITY) for the 2021-2022 academic year

WHEREAS the Faculty Senate voted to approve a resolution forming the Ad Hoc committee to Promote Anti-Racism Initiatives This Year (PARITY) in October 2020, charging the committee to:

Gather and disseminate information on faculty- and administration-led anti-racism initiatives at SUNY Old Westbury and within the SUNY system;

Identify and implement initiatives to advance the June 2020's dedication of this academic year to a curricular and co-curricular exploration of topics related to racial (in)equity, (in)justice, and movements for social change;

Advocate for support for relevant initiatives from the administration; 

Collaborate with key stakeholders on campus and within the SUNY system, such as the Student Government Association, the administration, the SUNY Black Faculty and Staff Collective, University Faculty Senate, UUP, CSEA, and others to identify and implement anti-racism initiatives



WHEREAS the above referenced resolution called for the Senate to assess the continued role for this Ad Hoc committee in early fall 2021, including determining whether a continued need for this type of work might justify a bylaws revision to reconstitute PARITY as a standing committee in the future.



WHEREAS the 2020-2021 annual report that PARITY has submitted to the Senate recommends that PARITY's work be extended another year.



Therefore, be it



RESOLVED that the Ad Hoc faculty and staff committee to Promote Anti-Racist Initiatives This Year (PARITY) be extended for the 2021-2022 academic year; and, be it further

RESOLVED that Senate assess the continued role for this Ad Hoc committee in early fall 2022, including determining whether a continued need for this type of work might justify a bylaws revision to reconstitute PARITY as a standing committee in the future.
