: Whereas,

The CAP Committee wishes to express its profound concern with the

possibility of changing from a 4-credit course model to a 3-credit course model, and
Whereas,
The CAP Committee is convinced such a change is likely to have a negative
impact on the educational quality of our courses and our curriculum, and
Whereas,

There is strong consensus among the faculty and unanimity within CAP that
potential ramifications include:
e
e

Preventing full curricular coverage for individual courses, as well as broader
curricular program requirements;
Causing insufficient classroom-based time for students to cover in-depth

e
e
e

Militating against the integration of innovative educational technologies;
Compromising faculty's continued use of exemplary active learning pedagogy:
Expanding course loads for students to create further difficulties for students

course material;

with substantial non-academic responsibilities; and

Whereas,
We strongly object to the current process because it bypasses faculty
governance bodies and prevents a high quality effort to "collect data, evaluate the
findings, and make a recommendation," as per the President's charge to the Task
Force on Credit Hours,
Be it Resolved,

That the Task Force on Credit Hours be disbanded and a representative

governance body be convened after the appointment of a new Vice President for
Academic Affairs.
