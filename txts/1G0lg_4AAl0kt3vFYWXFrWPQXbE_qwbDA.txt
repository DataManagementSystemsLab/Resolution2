Information pre-advising/registration-

FY worked collaboratively to develop a FY survey and Welcome packet with Orientation, SAS, EOP, and the Academic Advising Center. The Welcome packet included our course offerings and an introduction to our program.  FY embedded questions in the orientation survey inquiring about student course preferences, AP and IB courses. This information was used to build new student schedules. During New Student Orientation sessions advisors met with the students to discuss schedules and make necessary corrections.

First Year in collaboration with EOP and the Academic Advising Center conducted 4 pre-advising/registration meetings for the 4 New Student Orientation Sessions. 

We were able to pre-advise/register 733 students enrolled in orientation.

Pre-advising/registration sessions included 4 advisors from Academic Advising, 2 advisors from EOP and 4 advisors from First Year.  TOTAL= 10 advisors

In addition to FY, EOP staff and Academic Advising, additional advisors were hired for New Student Orientation sessions according to student enrollment.
