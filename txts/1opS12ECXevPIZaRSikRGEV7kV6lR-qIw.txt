Campus Green Committee
Proposed Working Groups – Spring 2020
DRAFT
For Discussion at February 18th Meeting of Green Committee
The following proposed Working Groups are consistent with models in SUNY and higher education
nationwide, for the organization of campus sustainability and green campus initiatives and operations.
When Old Westbury’s Green Committee was initially established (2009-2010), similar categories were used
to undertake a campus Sustainability Audit in which students worked alongside faculty and staff. Members
of the re-established Green Committee may opt to participate in Working Group(s) of greatest personal
interest or profession relevance. It is anticipated that each group will select group leader(s) or coordinator(s).

1) Energy: energy use, emissions, renewable sources, carbon footprint
2) Recycling: recycling, paper/plastic/metal/glass waste stream, green materials
3) Transportation: campus vehicles, campus shuttle, mass transit, charging stations
4) Food: food sourcing, food recovery/donation, community garden, dining services
5) Water: water usage, conservation, glacial aquifer, pollutants
6) Land: environmental stewardship, trees, open space, wildlife habitat
7) Climate change: awareness, engagement, climate justice, community outreach
8) Sustainability literacy: models, environmental education, interconnected learning
9) Sustainability website: develop/manage Green campus website; other social media
10) Funding: initiating grants/partnerships in support of Green campus activities
