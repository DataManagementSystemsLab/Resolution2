1 I teach two graduate courses with students that I have last semester. I
know them, they know me, they know each other. There is a feeling of
belonging to he same community that is quite pleasant

1 Missing classroom proximity causes affective precariousness and
pedagogical failure
2 Can’t log onto ConnectOW consistently. And the connection to Bb is
finicky students and me.
2 It is highly inefficient. It requires more work from the instructor and
results in poorer instruction. This is particularly true for complicated,
abstract concepts.
2 Serious technological problems
2 Since I have an iPad it works great to screen share to the students my
lessons. It is difficult for students to learn math online as opposed to
having an in school teacher.
2 Student involvement very poor and I fear covid-19 is used as a bit of an
excuse. The lack of support from SUNY Old Westbury to require student
cameras to be makes the situation even worse.

2 The students don’t have their cameras on and I can’t mandate that they
do given our unequal access to technology. Beyond this there’s something
essential missing when not meeting in person. Learning is necessarily
interactive and personal. But given the circumstances this is the best we
can do.
3 Access to OW portal is problematic. I use multiple different browsers to
find one which will support my course obligations. It is not consistent.

3 Benefits include allowing students to learn from wherever they are which saves them a lot of commute time. That matters for people who
work, care for others, etc. Another benefit is the screen sharing and
breakout rooms are great and more functional than some of the
classrooms at OW in terms of technological capacity. Convos with
students after class can still happen - and are actually quite nice in the
zoom space. Bad stuff: It is really hard to get people to participate
without forcing them in punitive ways. There are always a strong
minority, but the others are keeping screens off and not talking much. I
have tried multiple avenues to correct this, and breakout groups work
really well, but it is still challenging. It is also challenging to 'read the
room' which is a vital component of teaching.

3 cannot check student participation
3 Every single time I attempt to log into the Portal, I have to clear my cache.
It does not matter which browser I use. I have reported to IT to no avail.
This is affecting my students, also.
3 Getting more of the knack of how to teach remote, however, difficult to
engage the students
3 I am a contact person. The students facial expression and mannerisms
help drive my instructions. Students use to say after class and talk I am
not getting that relationship.
3 I appreciate that remote learning is keeping us all safe, but it is certainly
inferior to in-person instruction. Remote instruction requires substantially
more work, but results in substantially less learning. Plus, students are
facing an array of challenges (technological, financial, familial, mental
health) that make it difficult for them to fully engage in remote learning.

3 I don't like that the large majority of my students won't use their
cameras. I don't like talking to black boxes. I suspect many of them aren't
even there. It's also hard monitoring the chat and the oral comments,
too. I think there's a power struggle that begins when I try to get them to
use their cameras, and I don't ever win.

No

3 I believe some students are "distracted" by not being in class. They are
seemingly falling out of "school-mode" having been away from the
classroom for so many months. By staying at home, they can't get time
away from the many obvious issues. Sadly, I don't have an immediate
solution.
3 I believe we are fulfilling the learning objectives, but keeping student
engagement up is a little challenging.
3 I cannot seem to motivate my students to turn oon their video. This
makes teaching difficult. How does one teach to 28 black boxes? I miss
the personal interaction and having to talk some students "off the ledge"
by email and telephone.
3 I deeply dislike teaching online, so I didn't chose the value "1" just
because I accept the situation and given the circumstances, I do
sporadically find some joy in teaching. The fact that we can't make
students turn their cameras on as a way to "attend" a class makes
teaching lonely, alienated, and far less efficient since we can't get that
immediate feedback received by seeing someone's facial reactions.

3 I feel like it is working well enough with students that are already more
engaged, but for those students who will barely talk or won't even post a
picture, I have no idea if they are getting any of the content at all, and I

3 I love my students and they are generally coming to class and
participating. They are just overwhelmed by the remote experience as
first-year students. I fear that we will loose several of them and that the
failure rate will disproportionately impact our economically challenged
diverse population. I believe that we must revisit extending the Cr/NC
option.
3 I think I’ve made a connection with some of the students but not with as
many as I would in a classroom setting. I have less ability to motivate
them. Much happens in conversations in hallways in a drop in the office
that make a difference for students.

3 In the classzoom sessions I have lost some ability to gauge if the students
understand the content. In remote instruction I have found less student
feedback and nonverbal clues that I now realize I significantly depended
on in the face-to-face instruction. The assessments (tests) are difficult to
navigate between rigor and fairness, while trying to minimize student use
of external resources. I feel sometimes that students have pressure to
cheat because of their perception that others in the class are doing so,
which may not be the case. Also I worry that while students might be able
to arrange a dedicated time for the zoom sessions, they may not have a
dedicated space, like a classroom gives them. For example, living in a
noisy apartment or being distracted by others in their household while
taking an exam.

Maybe

No

3 It has gone better than expected, with surprising advantages to using
Zoom for teaching writing (sharing my screen, the chat feature). But it is
harder to get to know each student--some of them don't use or don't

3 It is difficult to navigate Zoom. One class ends up with two links if I don't
have recurring sessions. I can't get polls to work unless they are set up in
advance so it is more difficult to work off student comments and
discussions. Makes it tough to generate enthusiasm if I can't use tools to
draw them in.

3 It is very evident to me that many of the students are not putting in the
same amount effort or attention that they would had we been on

3 It's a mixed bag. Pros: Students are engaged, we've developed a rhythm,
they are becoming more comfortable; cons: many students do not turn
on cameras, which constrains interaction and discussion, it's hard to know
who is engaged and who is not. One can enter room and not stay in class
for the entire period. Cannot read body language or get to know students.

3 I've found it's hard to pivot in lessons if something isn't working. This is
easy in a class, to switch gears. But even though I typically have several
potential activities aimed at getting course materials' discussed, it is hard
to move from one to another.Don't want to insist that students keep
cameras on, but it's tough when they are off. Students are generally
doing their work, but it's hard to give them attention one would like given

3 Teaching remote vs teaching face-to-face has both its pros and cons. Pros
could be that student feel safe and have more time as they save lot of
commuting time but as a faculty I feel the cons are I am not able to
interact with the students as often as I would want to. I am also not able
to see the responses or reactions of my students to be able to make a
decision how the class is moving ahead. Also its difficult to get students to
work in groups in an online setting despite the fact that we have breakout
rooms available but I feel it doesn't work as well as it would in a face-toface set up.

3 Things are going great during discussions--perhaps as well, if not better,
than in in-person classes. But, students--in the online platform--are not
turning in assignments in the numbers expected (for my survey class, at
least a quarter of folks don't turn in the work--the hope is they will
eventually).
3 This fall is going better than last spring, in part because I'm more used to
online teaching and more experience with it. I'm still not happy with the
level of engagement with he students. My cajoling was insufficient to get
most of them to turn on their cameras for class, and my two intro classes
at really too large (>35 students) for really close engagement with all the
students.
3 Zoom is working well. Many students are having repeated problems
logging into the portal and Bb. Bb is poorly designed & hard for students
to navigate, I wish we had a more contemporary and intuitive LMS,
additionally the Bb mobile app is awful. I spend a lot of time in office
hours and over email helping students find things on Bb. Our students are
so overwhelmed by work, tech challenges, family, etc that is is very hard
for them to focus on their studies this semester.

4 I feel the combination of face-to-face synchronous classes via ZOOM
using our common Blackboard platform has been helpful to facilitating
student learning. The asynchronous courses are still interactive and
include use of Blackboard and Google Classroom technology. It's been a

delivery has been working for students based on feedback from students.

track of them. It's still different than being in person.
4 I have all the tools I need, so I feel everything is running smoothly on my
end. However I still struggle with student participation. I feel that I am
extending myself over above and beyond only for students to tell me they
"just cannot learn" this way or they "just cannot learn" that way. It's

4 I teach synchronous courses using Blackboard Collaborate Ultra. I can
deliver lectures as in F2F courses and have students work in a small group
environment using Breakout Groups, and assess their understanding

getting disconnected time to time due to unstable network. I wish there

4 It has been a positive experience given the safety and health concerns
regarding the pandemic. My students are responding well to an online

4 It has more to do with technology and students not having access to
consistent WiFi, or not being able to navigate Blackboard and see my
comments, and sometimes my emails are delayed or their emails are
delayed when sent to me.
4 It is hard to see how engaged students are without their cameras on. At
some instances, I see some of my students are joining from their jobs, or
just logging in but not responding to questions. It is also challenging to
teach video editing software remotely. Some of the students are having
issues with installing the software to their computers due to account
problems.
4 It varies quite a bit; some days I feel like "I've got this," and others, I feel
like I am struggling to stay on top of things.

4 The low-density on-site instruction has gone well. However, the course
that I teach is a laboratory, and this does require student attendance in

5 Everything has been pretty smooth and the college has provided

5 Have been able to effectively use Zoom to keep the students engaged
through multimedia and breakout sessions for group exercises.
5 I enjoy teaching online and working from home. I would prefer that things
stay this way for the future.
5 I feel I am able to teach effectively and have agency in my teaching.
Attendance and student performance is on par with in person courses.
More preparation work and organization is required and interacting with
students outside of class takes more time. Having taught remotely for a
semester, I have a better understanding of what will and won't work.
5 I feel like my students are more involved and engaged than they are in
the classroom
5 I hate it. I'm sick of being Zoom Bombed.
5 I have figured out a way to keep my students engaged throughout the
lesson. They are constantly writing and talking and in some ways I can
actively monitor their growth. And they can too.
5 I like working from home.
5 I teach all synchronous. Students are engaged, good attendance and
keeping up with assignments.
5 I think it has been going great. The students are a bit more experienced
after last semester.
5 I think remote instruction is going well. I have had few issues with
technology and feel that my course is structured and organized through
BlackBoard. I do, however, miss interacting with my students (not
virtually!).
5 My students and I have some flexibility and some contact, and with a
clear schedule at the beginning of the semester, we've not have any
problems with remembering assignment or anything else
5 My technology needs to teach synchronously via BlackBoard are being
met. The ability to access Zoom or Collaborate facilitates instruction
across platforms in one space. BlackBoard has simplified my instruction
and communication.

Q6 Other Concerns for F20 Remote Instruction

Q14
Faculty

I believe that, at a minimum, students should be allowed to come to campus and utilize
the computer labs and/or other areas where they can access computers and the internet.
Many of my students are taking class on their phones or computers that are 15-20 years
old. They are at a severe disadvantage in situations like this.

Yes

No

Non-TT

I find that student stress and students' increased responsibilities have created a situation
where (because students share computers, bandwidth, study time with children and
others in their families) everyone is under increased levels of stress and old deadlines
often are impossible to meet so I have to give more time, and as a result less class
material is covered, though often students go more in-depth with the material they do
cover.
Thank heavens for Zoom!!!!! I find it an easy platform with which to teach.
My primary concern is student engagement and motivation. I think remote learning, inand-of itself isn't the problem, it's the civil unrest, pandemic, economy, and election
(etc.) that are on people's mind. And mine. Probably the single biggest issue is the variety
of technology access. Some students attend on their phone, for example.

I am an adjunct and I was not paid until October 14 I don't know how they expect anyone
to teach remotely Without any income to maintain Internet and power services let alone
eat through midterms.
The uncertainty of knowing the extent to which my students have adequate computer
hardware/connections is an ongoing concern and complicates all aspects of teaching
online. In non-Covid semesters, students could use the college machines/labs to do the
work -- this meant if a student signed up for an online class, they had an obligation to
have a plan for doing the work. At least one community college that I know of -- in
Newark -- has turned their gym into a large, properly ventilated and socially distanced
space for their students to use when needed. I see this is listed below -- I think it should
be a major priority.

student participation remains a challenge, as the anonymity of the medium hinders my
ability to make eye contact with students, and enforcing the use of the camera is an
issue.
From what I have been told, some of my students are signing on to class (I teach two
synchronous classes) from well outside the NY Metro -- including Asia. I suspect this has
added to their stress, especially in terms of technology and time-zone issues. As English
sometimes isn't their native language it is harder to provide writing assistance. There's
only so much that can be done by phone/computer.

Teachers feel they are putting in more work, and students feel that they are putting in
more work too. This tends to be the same complaints from both sides. I think that the
President and the Provost can do more to put a constructive tone into the conversation.
Rather than just making a video thanking everyone, put the struggle into a bigger context
-- talk about being part of history, our role according to the mission of the college, how
far the college has come, and where we are going. Focus on motivation and vision. Help

THere's got to be a better way to streamline interesting exercises to build community

I feel as though the students feel very disconnected....and is very difficult to engage the

It has been taken significantly more time to find the equivalent materials digitally to use

I just feel it isn't as authentic as in class instruction.
The increased number of and length of meetings due to necessary Contingency planning,
curricular shifts, etc. has increased time in meetings by about 75%, therefore leaving less
time during work hours for grading and curriculum development (and research/writing).
Given that there is no ability to walk into a colleague's office for 5 minutes to confer on a
matter, every conversation becomes a Zoom meeting, and therefore ends up taking up a
larger portion of the day than it would have otherwise. Office hours also seem to take up

I have spent a fortune in buying everything from a comfortable chair to a new router. I

I have not found that the change in format has been much more challenging or difficult
given that I had been teaching hybrid courses for many years. The issue has been more
about coping with the stressors related to the pandemic as well as assisting my students

of the stressors brought about by the pandemic and at the same time have put significant
effort in engaging with the material presented and discussed in class. Attendance,

Q8 Other resources that will help remote instruction

Part of the problem since we went fully online in March is less time because of the
increased number of emails that I have to sort through. I expect emails from students,
though students' expectations of classes have changed since we are fully remote. The
number and frequency of faculty emails is what I find time consuming. These are
probably reflective of a greater degree of faculty anxiety. I found, as I was considering
the boxes that I checked above, that the "will help a lot" was mitigated by the amount
of *more* time it would take from what I am already trying to complete during the
semester.

Q10 Reason for Q9 - "My remote courses would be more effective in
classrooms in the COVID-Safe condition"
A blended approach where we see students sometimes would allay their
anxiety and more easily build a learning community. It would be easier to
give exams and grade written essays rather than wait for the SafeAssign in
Blackboard which doesn't work automatically.
Developing a healthy and professional rapport with students is how I am able
to engage the students in person. This allows for more questions in person
and more flow of the class. It is extremely tiresome to engage students
remotely.
Face to face is always better
Face to Face is extremely effective vs Remote
Hands-on activities are difficult to do. I have access to virtual manipulatives;
however, the experiences are not the same.
Formative assessments are difficult to do. I can't eavesdrop on student
conversation. I can't watch them try tasks.
Having the students face to face (many students do not show themselves)
allows the professor to assess learning, and more students are likely to
participate in a traditional class.
I’m doing it at Hofstra and have been able form relationships that help
students stay motivated and offer them a chance to engage with a professor
in more informal settings
missing the interaction - and so are the students
My students completed a paper on effects of the COVID on their lives. Most
of them did not embrace online classes.
Obviously being able to interact with the students directly is better than the
computer screen. However, as long as this virus impacts us, we need t stay
the course
Remote instruction is a very inefficient use of highly trained faculty, who are
used to teaching often difficult subjects to a smallish group in a classroom
space. It requires more work for poorer results.
Teaching especially in the humanities requires in person instruction for
optimal results. Something happens in the meetings of mind in a classroom
setting that cannot be attained online. There are also fewer distractions that
take away from learning when we remove ourselves from our private homes.
that way, i would be able to see which students are participating and which
one are just taking up space
The in-person interaction is critical.
There is no replication for in-person teaching

This is a double-edged sword. We need to begin getting back to normal and
other schools in the area (i.e., Hofstra, Stonybrook, Farmingdale, etc.) have
been doing hybrid classes. The level that our students are at (I think) requires
in-person education. However, the backgrounds that many of our students
come from have been affected heavily by COVID, so that's the other side of
the sword. I'm not quite sure how to reconcile these issues.

I am surprised to find that the students are learning so much in our online
remote lab for Chem 1. I did not expect the course to go so well online. We
go through each lab together during class time, and students are able to focus
on the theory, developing procedures, and understanding the point of the
actual experiment. I am able to answer their questions and everyone can
hear and contribute their ideas in the chat box or verbally. In the campus
laboratory, I can go around the lab and help individual students, but no one
else gets the benefit of hearing the Q and A. They are truly learning the
meaning of precision and accuracy, are adept at calculating standard
deviation by hand, are learning better how to make graphs, and are better at
identifying sources of error. They have more time to think about the lab
rather than be lost in the details of carrying out the lab. They are writing
better and more thoughtful lab reports. The Hayden-McNeil lab simulations
are working well and give them a feel for how one carries out the experiment
in the lab. They learn about safety concerns of different chemicals, etc. I
think that going forward, the first semester course may be best taught
remotely. They will be much better prepared to carry out labs in subsequent
courses. I think that lab simulations and "dry labs" can play an important role
in all of our lab courses even after we return to campus.

to think that just being in person solves eveyrthing. I think we need to think
harder about how to require students to engage with classes rather than
forcing everything to be back on campus. Expectations for time synchronous
sessions, one-on-one office hours remotely, and guidelines about students
engaging with cameras on (with device support) could go a long way. I am
also very concerned about asking faculty to "do everything", essentially
requiring faculty to both teach on campus with a commute as well as being
available constantly online.

I believe it could put students back into "school-mode" and give them some
time away from the obvious issues at home. It also would especially enable
me to provide more customized instruction to those students who are
"struggling" or "stressed." But, would they feel "safe", and would travel to
class, by whatever mode, add to their expenses at a time of financial
difficulty.
I don’t have an opinion on this specific question. But students need to
develop a sense of belonging to their class in person.
I don't feel very safe even if the school creates a "Covid-safe" space. There
are always people who don't follow the protocols and who don't wear masks
appropriately.
I have taken a lot of time to transfer what I did in the classroom to a
successful remote model.
I need one more semester of teaching virtually to be able to answer this
quesiton.
I started the semester with small on campus meetings with students. The
attendance was dismal, less than 15%. I had to cancel the meetings. I am not
sure that on campus meetings will be successful if the situation is still
impacted strongly by the virus. Students are not comfortable coming to
campus in person or using public transportation. Some are living at home
with at risk family members or are themselves at risk, or are simply afraid to
catch the virus, in spite of social distancing and mask-wearing.

Q10 Reason for Q9 - "My remote courses would be more effective in
classrooms in the COVID-Safe condition"
I would be able to interact more often with my students and especially those
who are struggling in my class.
I would have to think about it; it could be more stressful to meet in person. I
haven't been in a room with more than a few people in it in months, for
example.
I’m unsure.
If the class density is appropriate for a class with a lab component
I'm fairly happy with the remote lectures. It would be better to meet in
person, but I'm not sure it would be worth the hassle, especially if the
students weren't already on campus for their other classes. However, having
exams in person would be a big improvement.
I'm not sure that having space on campus will make a difference as it will
depend on the students feeling comfortable attending campus. The process
of teaching hybrid remote and in-class is a big ask and quite a difficult balance
to manage.
I'm not sure what you mean. If they were taught on campus, they would no
longer be "remote" courses, correct? Do I think a blended model would be
more effective pedagogically? Yes, but do I think we should move to that
model? Definitely not. The pandemic is affecting every aspect of students
lives, and as hard as it is for them to engage remotely, I think it would be
harder for them to regularly get to campus. Dorms would help. The library
would help. Computer centers and quality tech support would help. But inperson classes would make things harder for students, based on what I see.

In person interaction with students is better than online lectures. Social
distancing will not be practical for my usual large classes.
In-person instruction is what I'm used to and, so far, my suspicion that it's
more effective for instruction bears out.
In-person teaching is always good. Yet, as we do not know the origin of Covid
and the way they spread, it may not work well. Nobody prefer back and forth
of the possible opening of shcool.
It may be helpful to meet with students occasionally throughout the semester
to model certain teaching strategies that they are implementing or have them
work with the materials.
It really depends on the nature of the courses. For instance, I teach media
production courses, and it is not easy to maintain a safe social distance in
some instances. I think that it would be a good alternative to have certain
sessions on campus while keeping the remaining portions of class meetings
online.

I have a small number of students who could be benefited by being in a
physical classroom space. For a majority of students, though, I think remote
instruction is preferable over "COVID-safe" on campus instruction. I don't
think so-call the "flex" model would have worked for me for multiple reasons.
Neither me nor my students have enough confidence in our ability to keep
classrooms safe.
I have no issues being remote.
I have taught in a hybrid format at another university and it is difficult to
manage '2' classrooms
I have very motivated graduate students who are one semester from
graduation. Most wok full-time and not having to go on campus save them
time and money. It's not the case with undergraduate students who need
more real time with their instructor to stay engaged.

I realize that SUNY is pushing for some on-site meetings. But the term 'COVIDsafe' I cannot take seriously, with the rising rates of infections currently
occurring. The College has yet to broadcast its cleaning methods (how
frequent, etc.) to the wider community. At this time, I do not think that the
College can guarantee that the learning environment can be 100% safe.

Yes

No

I think for my subject, the cost/benefit analysis would point to staying
remote.
I think making classes partly in-person and partly online would create
challenges for many of our already challenged students. Unless they can dorm
on campus, asking them to come to campus, even on an irregular schedule,
would create more of a burden on them. I think more money for laptops,
cameras for students--rather than money for extra cleaning and plexiglass-makes more sense.
I think students will not feel safe coming to campus. I think classes need to be
all remote or all face to face.
I think the safety of remote is better for students and faculty. I would have a
hard time monitoring attendance.

I would be too anxious and thinking about catching COVID to focus on
teaching. One may be able to make the classroom COVID safer, but there's
going to be people not (correctly) wearing masks, and the mask requirement
won't be effectively enforced, just like "no-smoking-areas" of campus are not
enforced. For those of us who use public transit (NYC subway, LIRR, and then
the OW shuttle bus), getting to campus is not going to be COVID safe, so I
just hope teaching in-person is not going to be mandatory. Also I'm not sure
one can social distance in the halls or bathrooms in the NAB. BTW instead of
saying "COVID-safe" maybe one should use the term COVID-safeR?

I'm not personally confident in how safe on campus classes would ultimately
be.
My biggest issue is participation - and I cannot do in-person groups while also
social distancing. So, lecture-style participation would improve, but learning
in my class takes place more in small group activities and discussions, so this
would not improve it during COVID times.
My courses were remote before COVID; they are the same now as they were,
brought up to date. That has not changed.
My remote courses are the same as in-person courses because they are
synchronous. As long as students have stable internet connection, there
should not be any problem. If students miss the lecture, they can listen to the
recorded lectures.
Overall, we are doing well with remote instruction. I have modified my
courses and I meet students synchronously for 1-1.5 hours per week only. I
have 3 hour long classes and expecting students to stay online for 3 hours is
just not realistic or optimal so I have asynchronous components to the
courses as well (e.g. recorded lectures, journals/discussion boards, small
group activities, links to videos and webinars, quizzes, etc.)

Remote instruction has been hard to acclimate to, but I'm there now. It's
more work in some ways, and harder in some ways. But it's more rewarding
in other ways. It allows for an intimacy and comfort in the classroom that in
person does not accommodate (everyone is generally at home and
comfortable).
Simultaneously teaching a combo of virtual and live students is impossible in
an active classroom learning/ teaching style. The teaching strategies are so
different. You can not engage virtual students well while also focusing on inperson students. If all students could return to class and we didn't need to
also include virtual learning, this would be more manageable. Most NYC
public school teachers are working 14-hours a day, 7 days a week trying to
keep up with planning to provide dual modality classes with a mix of virtual
and remote students. Most agree fully remote would be better for their
students at this point. We need to respect the pedological differences of the
two modalities and consider instructor work load. Prep for remote is totally
different than prep for live. The mixed model really only works well for those
who lecture the entire class, but for those of us who have active learning
classrooms with group work, peer feedback, etc. it is impossible to
simultaneously teach to virtual and live groups and fully engaged all the
students.

Thank you for asking :)
Thank heavens for Zoom!!!!!!!!
Question 11: Had experience with Hybrid, not fully online.
I am extremely fortunate in having marvelous colleagues. We've met in person ( masked and
social distanced) , on Zoom and MS Teams, talked by phone, and often exchanged emails.
Likewise, the Dean, my chair, and the admin staff have been of enormous help-- both
solicited and unsolicited. I've never heard "no" or "too busy. " It's always "how can I help?"
There also often are "just-checking-in" notes What a joy, especially in this environment.
Again, I think IT needs a process for helping students that is more transparent and more
immediate. When I suggest that students contact IT, my feeling is they don't expect a
response. When I have contacted IT educational people directly (as I know I shouldn't) I have
gotten great help and very quickly. But my impression is that students don't have access to
such help.
Faculty need control over their computers - admin privileges. In normal times, where we can
go to the IT desk regularly to get programs installed, it is painfully inconvenient. Now, it is
truly hindering our ability to do our jobs to not be able to download programs to enhance
teaching remotely, uninstall/reinstall programs having issues (I've had Word and sound
issues just in the last few weeks), etc.
Let's try some low-density flex/hybrid instruction as soon as it is safe. Starting with some
test classes on a voluntary basis. We need to learn from our mistakes before we roll
something out for the whole college.
I would love to teach in person under COVID safe guidelines and I believe the students would
too. Even giving students an option to attend in person vs virtually. For twice a week classes
(just an idea), splitting each class in half so that for Monday/Wednesday, half would come
on Monday while the other half is learning synchronously and the Wednesday they would
flip-flop.
Thanks for asking. We are doing the best we can and the students seem to realize it.
The biggest hurdle for me this semester has just been the extra work of transitioning my
course materials from in person to online.
NA
Grateful for the support of all faculty.
I think remote teaching is a teaching method that we need to explore given that 90% of my
students are employed and have challenges to come to campus for all the courses. A
combination of on campus and remote course will help them graduate timely.
The College needs to view "remote" instruction as a strong, viable, legitimate, even more
effective means of educational delivery. The need for community building in and out of
classes, student life, and so forth, needs greater attention, so that the Academic Division
works well with the Student Development division.

It concerns me that registration is opening next week and the college has not announced
whether classes will be remote again.
I realize everyone is trying their best. It's just what has to be right now.
N/A
Many students seem to value the sync live classes more than I expected and I will do more
of this moving forward. I will also include more drop in office hours and informal out of class
opportunities for small groups of students to interact moving forward.
Overall, as faculty, we are doing the best that we can in terms of instructing our students
during this current situation. The college has provided excellent resources including
increased IT support and learning demonstrations as well as allowing for low-density in-class
teaching sessions, which helps to optimize our instruction and provide the best education
that we can for our students. I want to thank the college for all of their help and support.
I ensure to share (repeatedly) a schedule for that week's work with my students not so much
because they aren't paying attention but because, like everyone, I imagine, every day is
"blursday" and my reminders help to keep them moving forward. I also check attendance at
least three times during my 90 minute class and if I see them dropping off from the session, I
follow up with an email. They might give me any excuse initially but they are there the next
class fully present, engaged, and participating for entire duration of the class.
I think that the College should revisit the synchronous/asynchronous distinctions. While I
have really been enjoying the synchronous meetings (and I wouldn't do anything different
next time around), some classes might simply work better asynchronously. For instance: I
have spoken with colleagues who are teaching asynchronous classes; they don't have
trouble with webcam issues (because there are none!), and students still enjoy the material
in the courses. That faculty were asked to 'justify' asynchronous courses may have
discouraged faculty from choosing a modality that would work best for them.
In Person Blackboard Workshops would be very beneficial
I think remote instruction is going well, for my classes. It's also more convenient for students
who always have a difficult time commuting to campus.
At present the classes I am teaching are going well and me and my students feel supported
by the college.
Thank you for this. I look forward to learning the results and having a chance to talk with
colleagues to come up with creative solutions to our problems.
I have not been able to participate in online teaching workshops due to service
commitments in addition to teaching, I just do not have any free time to do it. A release for
faculty on service would allow us to focus more on what is most important right now, which
is to provide students the best education possible under the current circumstances.
