The Value and Need of (More) Training

The m ost valuable aspects of the AFP are 1) the structured and
scaffolded assignm ents that assisted m y departm ent in creating a
robust assessm ent program and 2) the ability to discuss assessm ent
with m y colleagues from across the School of Arts and Sciences.

I think there in general m ore tim e needs to be devoted to training faculty
about what exactly is assessm ent, about basic term inology and how to
organize this project for each program .

Alignment & Coordination
W e need an alignm ent between what we are learning in AFs
roundtables/workshops and what the College infrastructure looks
like. For exam ple, the roll out of W eave as a sim plistic reporting
tool seem ed to really underm ine em erging investm ent in
developing a culture of assessm ent - as did conversations about
carrots and sticks. [… ] Inconsistent m essaging [… ] m akes the
roles of AFs politically quite com plicated in their departm ents, and
therefore potentially unsustainable.
This is not necessarily reflective of the AF program , but we were
getting uncoordinated assessm ent tasks and inform ation from
various cam pus authorities over the course of Fall 2021, and that
m ade the process unnecessarily confusing.”

Workload Concerns

The AF program has taken substantial am ounts of m y tim e [… ], and I
think a course release w as really the m inim um com pensation that
could be offered for this [… ] and so I am a little concerned as to how
heavy the workload will be with the Assessm ent Coordinator System ,
especially if the com pensation w ill be reduced.

[It] w ould also be incredibly helpful if there w as one AC per Program not per departm ent. There is a lot to m anage for each Program , and
having som eone w ho could focus on each w ould not only m ake this a
m ore realistic w orkload, but ensure that the "bigger" m ajor isn't
neglected in term s of assessm ent/C tL .

College-wide Conversation & Vision
There really needs to be an alm ost college-w ide discussion that
centers on w hat has to happen w ith assessm ent. M eaning all
faculty need to know that those doing the coordinating are only
trying to get a job done and done effectively. How that is done I
don't know . But it seem s unfair for Assessm ent C oordinators to
have to run into w alls to try to get things done.

If w e don't develop better tools re: the basics of assessm ent and
clear m essaging from AA about the value of assessm ent to
faculty - not the requirem ent or risk of discipline - w e w ill not be
able to do this job in any m eaningful w ay .

Takeaways
u To m ove forw ard, w e need:
q

Enhanced assessment skills training and inter-departmental conversations in the Assessment
Fellows Program

q

Coordinated initiatives and messaging with a clear vision: Assessment as a constructive, collegewide project

q

Explicitly defined expectations for academic assessment & Fellows/Coordinator roles

q

College-wide conversations to facilitate shared understanding

q

Enhanced support for departments with multiple academic programs
