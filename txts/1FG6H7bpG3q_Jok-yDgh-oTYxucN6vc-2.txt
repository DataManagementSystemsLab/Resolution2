Professional development needs to advance emergency remote instruction to more robust
standards for remote instruction (including any cost projections)
Best practice suggestions for grading and proctoring (assessments of student learning
outcomes and measures to ensure academic integrity) in the remote/online teaching space
(Grading and Proctoring)(include any cost related projections)
Determine any outstanding infrastructural needs
Offer suggestions for a cost-effective scaling model that increases the use of online
learning methodologies for the fall.
Describe some scenarios that would address three potential situations (and other related
gradations between the three): the continuation of remote instruction, a blend that would
provide for some low density on-campus options, and a process scenario that would
provide greater agility and robust instruction for a "new normalized pandemic plan."
