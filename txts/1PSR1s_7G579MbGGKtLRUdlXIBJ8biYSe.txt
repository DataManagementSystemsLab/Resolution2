Resolution: Policy Regarding Student Participation in Clubs, Committees, and Intercollegiate
Athletics
Whereas academic probation is intended as a support measure designed to encourage students
to focus on their studies in order that they may satisfy academic standards; and
Whereas involvement in extracurricular college activities, such as clubs, committees, and
athletics often helps maintain studentsâ€™ engagement with the institution, and may thus help
maintain their commitment to meeting academic standards; and
Whereas barring students who have maintained a cumulative GPA of 2.00 or higher from
participating in such extracurricular activities is unnecessarily punitive, and may undermine
their connection to the institution;
Be it resolved that a student whose GPA for one semester is below 2.00, but maintains a
cumulative GPA of 2.00 or higher may still participate in student clubs, committees, and
intercollegiate athletics.
