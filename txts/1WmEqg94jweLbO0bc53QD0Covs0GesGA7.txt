Curriculum and Academic Planning Committee
Resolution for Introducing Micro-Credentials Program at Old Westbury
WHEREAS, SUNY’s Board of Trustees approved a Policy Framework in January 2018 which,
in part, acknowledges that the question of whether to offer micro-credential awards is subject to
local governance processes and approval; and
WHEREAS, thirteen campuses currently offer credit and/or non-credit bearing micro-credential
awards; and
WHEREAS, the School of Professional Studies presented a proposal to CAP in March 2018 for
Old Westbury to offer a Micro-Credential in Non-Profit Management; and
WHEREAS, CAP referred the question of micro-credentials along with a summary of its
discussion to the Senate Executive Committee for the faculty to consider as a body; and
WHEREAS, following a presentation to the full faculty in May 2018 by the Director of
Professional Studies, the Faculty Senate arranged for a Task Force to be formed composed of
representatives of the four Schools, Academic Affairs, Student Affairs, Student Government,
Academic Advising and the Registrar’s office, to discuss the introduction of micro-credentials;
and
WHEREAS, Old Westbury’s Micro-Credential Task Force Proposal indicates that offering
micro-credentials at Old Westbury may benefit current and prospective students in a variety of
ways, by attracting non-traditional (e.g., non-matriculated) students to the College and
motivating current students to complete their degrees (i.e., rewards for exploring an area of study
they would not have otherwise pursued, manageable secondary specializations, and employable
skill sets); and
WHEREAS, each proposal for a micro-credential award at Old Westbury would be subject to the
same process of local governance as minors and certificates, including demonstration of prior
collaboration with and approval by affected departments or programs;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Faculty Senate approves the offering of microcredentials at Old Westbury on a trial basis; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that initial micro-credential offerings, once approved, undergo
review by CAP after they have been in effect for one year; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the administration, in consultation with faculty governance,
set up a process for evaluating costs and identifying resources for implementing the microcredentials program.
Approved by CAP for submission to Senate, November 16, 2018.
