ongoing negotiation.

University of New York.

Context

Annual costs $9.5;
Total costs of contract $45 mil

Asking for reduction in expenditures;
Major disparity between CUNY and
SUNY costs

National and International
institutions recent experiences
informing our strategies

Moving Forward

This is a campus decision not a
library decision

Unlikely to get to YES without
significant reduction in costs

This by NO means impacts where
or how faculty publish

Recommendations and Q&A
Continue open dialog between
your office, your libraries, and your
faculty

Campuses need to be prepared if we
walk away for a time

WE will need to support each other
through this transition
