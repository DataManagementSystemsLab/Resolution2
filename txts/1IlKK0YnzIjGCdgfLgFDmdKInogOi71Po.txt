PRODIG BACKGROUND INFO
The SUNY PRODiG ("Promoting Recruitment, Opportunity, Diversity, Inclusion and Growth")
initiative aims to increase the representation of historically underrepresented faculty at
SUNY, including underrepresented minority faculty (“URM”) in general and women faculty of all
races in STEM fields (“WSTEM”). PRODiG initiative aims to take a comprehensive approach to
increasing faculty diversity by identifying historically underrepresented faculty, growing the pipeline

of URM and WSTEM students in academic careers, insisting that campuses employ best practices
empirically proven to reduce barriers to diversity in the faculty search process, and improving
recruitment and retention processes across the campuses. The stated goals of the PRODiG program
are in part for campuses to transform their
hiring processes, pipeline initiatives and faculty retention efforts.
Old Westbury’s college-wide PRODiG committee was established in 2019. In Summer 2019 faculty
representatives on the Old Westbury PRODiG committee were appointed under the direction
of college administration. Old Westbury's existing PRODiG committee has been responsible
for managing the PRODiG plan since summer 2019. The campus needs to improve on diversity,
equity and inclusion. While Old Westbury’s mission statement highlights social justice, the
campus needs to improve on diversity and inclusion based on the data which shows a gap (31%
difference) between the percentage of our students (55% in Fall 2018) and our tenure stream faculty
(24% in January 2018) who are members of underrepresented minorities. In particular, campus data
illustrate that there is a stark gap in the representation of Black & Latinx faculty among those who are
tenured and tenure-track. For example, as of January 2020 Black faculty comprised only 11% and
Latinx faculty comprised only 10% of tenure stream faculty, despite the fact that Black and
Latinx students constitute majority of our students, at 24.7% and 33%, respectively. Full-time Black
faculty are close to proportionally represented only among those on the non-tenure stream (22%).
Moreover, Native Americans comprised a scant 0.68% (and 0.4 % of full-time students) although
the college is located on ceded Indigenous lands, and Asians comprised only 17% of tenure stream
faculty (and 10.6% of full-time students).
PRODIG COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
The Faculty Senate has accepted the establishment of the college-wide PRODiG committee that:
1. sets a rigorous standard in terms of guiding towards remedying existing major gaps in the
recruitment, hiring and retention of URM and WSTEM faculty, 2. understands the intertwined nature
of diversity, equity and inclusion. 3. concretely plans for future sustainable and rigorous DEI expertise
within administrative units charged with institutional equity and diversity. With required institutional
support and investment—the committee will support rigorous assessment of multi-level barriers and
facilitators of PRODiG (and other URM and WSTEM) faculty satisfaction and success, and ensure
that these data are transparent and widely available. The faculty membership on
the PRODiG Committee shall consist of at least 2/3 tenured faculty; all of whom will preferably
have conceptual or methodological expertise (in the form of scholarship or practice) in one or more of
the following areas: 1. qualitative and quantitative social science data collection, 2. contemporary
theories of barriers and facilitators of institutional equity, 3. Black, Latinx, Asian, Indigenous, or
critical race or ethnic studies, 4. theories of anti-racist institutional transformation, 5. critical
university studies.
