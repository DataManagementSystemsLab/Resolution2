SUNY OLD WESTBURY CAMPUS HISTORY

The College at Old Westbury was chartered in 1965 by then SUNY Chancellor, Samuel B. Gould, who sought to add to the state system a college that was innovative in curricula and academic policy. 

The College’s first president, Harris Wofford, envisioned the creation of a small experimental institution centered on a common core of courses and individualized student projects that would draw a diverse but talented group of students and faculty together. 

The concept of one-third, one-third, and one-third.

SUNY Board of Trustees appointed Calvin O. Butts, III, President in September 1999.  As Pastor of the historic Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York City, he was/is recognized for his work as a community activist.

As the College celebrated its 50

th

 anniversary, diversity remains a trademark that sets it apart from other campuses within the State University of New York system.
