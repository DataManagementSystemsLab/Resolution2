Summary  of  Committee  Activity  and  Focus    
  
Focus  (from  TLRC’s  2012-­2013  Annual  Report)  
TLRC’s  activity  is  guided  by  the  committee’s  charge  and  purpose  summaries  here:    Promote,  
support,  and  facilitate  best  practices  and  innovations  in  teaching  and  learning,  focusing  on  
faculty  growth  and  assisting  junior  faculty  in  the  practice  of  teaching.  Communicate  and  
coordinate  the  open  and  interdisciplinary  exchange  of  ideas,  modes  of  instruction,  and  
pedagogical  tools/resources,  which  characterize  an  effective  teaching  and  learning  
environment  that  improves  student  learning  outcomes  especially  across  disciplinary  contexts.  
Organize  faculty  workshops  that  are  responsive  to  the  relevant  pedagogical  issues  of  the  
College,  which  include,  for  example,  classroom  management  techniques,  and  the  appropriate  
use/integration  of  technology  in  instruction  and  information  management.    Promote  synergy  
between  teaching  and  research,  including  presentation  by  scholars  and  speakers  (internal  
and  external).    Sustain  an  environment  that  promotes  quality  of  life,  faculty  development  and  
collaborations.

FEEDBACK  AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  (BY  ACTIVITY)  
  
01.  TLRC  New  Faculty  Orientation  
  
End  of  Year  Faculty  Survey:  Summarized  (25  respondents)  
● 60%  of  the  respondents  attended.    
● 40%  rated  it  “Excellent”,  60%  rated  it  “Good”  
  
Select  comments:    
○ “Include  more  info  about  the  tenure  process”  
○ “It  would  be  helpful  to  have  more  written  materials,  such  as  a  handbook  on  
what  should  be  included  in  syllabi,  etc.    Contact  information  and  frequently  
asked  questions  such  as  email  and  computer  support,  reserving  space,  and  
resources  available  to  instructors,  career  services,  tutoring,  etc)...”    
○ “It  should  have  been  much  sooner.”    
  
2013-­2014  Final  Committee  Meeting  
Assessment:  
● Overall  successful  event.     
● A  tad  rushed  but  there  are  many  advantages  to  holding  on  the  same  day  as  the  
first  Senate  meeting.     
Questions:    
● Can  we  make  the  tabling  portion  more  interactive?    
■ Table  bingo  passport  game.    
● Should  the  event  be  earlier  in  the  fall?    
Recommendations:  
● Coordinate  with  Academic  Affairs  to  avoid  overlap  with  AA  orientation.  
● Consider  scheduling  the  date  at  the  end  the  spring  term  to  avoid  rushed  
planning  in  the  fall.     
  
02-­07.    Engaging  Students:    Faculty  Roundtable  Series  
  
End  of  Year  Faculty  Survey:  Summarized  (25  respondents)

● All  but  one  respondent  rated  every  roundtables  as  “Excellent”  or  “Good”    
● One  rated  “Research  Skills  “Fair”  
  
Select  comments:    
○ “This  is  a  great  idea.    Thank  you.”  
○ “I  have  really  enjoyed  the  few  roundtable  discussions  that  I  attended.    It  would  
be  nice  to  have  a  longer  time  to  have  these  discussions  as  well  as  a  larger  
room.”     

○ “I  thought  this  year’s  program  was  great  and  the  topics  selected  were  serious  
(not  condescending)  and  worth  discussion.”    
○ The  roundtable  are  good  but  wish  they  could  be  more  focused  and  more  
structured,  so  we  can  really  learn  how  to  do  specific  things...(Powerpoints,  
portfolio  assessment).”    
○ “The  quality  and  focus  of  this  year’s  roundtables  was  excellent  and  made  an  
important  contribution  to  college  life.”    
○ “Add  a  practical  component  to  all  workshops.”    
○ “This  year’s  were  great;;  you  could  probably  repeat  and  expand  some  of  them.”

08.    Realizing  Old  Westbury’s  Mission,  Faculty  Conference  
  
End  of  Year  Faculty  Survey:  Summarized  (25  respondents)  
● 31%  of  respondents  attended  the  Annual  Conference    
● 2  rated  it  “Excellent”,  5  rated  it  “Good”,  1  rated  it  “Fair”    
  
Summary  of  comments:    
● The  majority  of  comments  suggested  the  timing  was  bad  leading  to  low  
attendance  (“busiest  week  of  the  semester”)  and  many  suggested  the  event  be  
moved  to  the  fall  term  or  earlier  in  the  spring  semester.    A  few  suggested  
scheduling  shorter  events  (such  as  a  series  of  Friday  half  day  conferences)  in  
place  of  the  full  day  annual  conference.     
Additional  sample  comments  
● This  year’s  conference  was  excellent-­serious  in  content  and  helpful  in  terms  of  
pedagogy  and  strategies  in  the  classroom.”    
● “I  thought  it  was  a  really  good  event.    I  was  somewhat  disappointed  by  the  
number  of  faculty  who  were  in  attendance  being  so  low,  but  I’m  not  sure  that  
had  anything  to  do  with  planning.”     
● “Perhaps  we  could  continue  with  themes  around  social  justice,  student  
engagement,  etc.  for  future  conferences.”    
  
B.    2013-­2014  Final  Committee  Meeting  
Assessment:  
● Attendance  was  very  low  
● Presentations  and  participation  were  both  of  high  quality  
Questions:    
● Was  it  too  hard  to  ask  for  organized  panels?  
● Should  we  ask  for  presentations  and  group  them  into  panels  ourselves?    
● Should  we  change  the  date?    Move  it  earlier  in  the  year?  
Recommendations:  
● Add  a  roundtable  recap  or  follow-­up  at  the  conference  
● New  faculty  showcase  (including  certificates)    
  
  
  
  

09.    TLRC  Website    
  
2013-­2014  Final  Committee  Meeting

● Develop  and  add  printed  resources  out  of  orientation  and  workshops.     
  
10.    John  Jay’s  Faculty  Center  Visit  
  
Chair  comments:    This  visit  was  very  helpful.    I  highly  recommend  that  the  committee  or  future  
chairs  explore  future  visits  to  other  Faculty  and  Learning  Centers.    I’m  happy  to  share  my  
notes  and  contacts.    Purchase  seems  to  have  a  great  Center  and  they  are  very  open  to  a  
visit.

Keynote Speaker: "Endangered Mission: The Impact of SUNY Initiatives"
Dr. Eileen Landy was elected Secretary of United University Professions in May 2001. She is an Associate Professor of Sociology at
SUNY College at Old Westbury.

Mission-Based Teaching in Psychology
Discuss activities that challenge student attitudes, opinions and behaviors toward sustainability and environmental issues. Topics such
as global food security, access to food resources, food information and misinformation, and the formation of attitudes toward food and
food products will be discussed. Techniques include social science survey methods, data analysis, and self-challenge models for
exploration of social justice. Discussions about field internships with regard to their placement value in community non-profit settings;
and about the value of field internships and mission-related placement settings. Discussion will focus on the importance of student
application of mission-based values and goals and the importance of community engagement in the education of undergraduate
psychology majors.

Succession Planning at State and Federal Agencies
Succession planning guides management in the development of a career path for employees interested in management, solidifies
plans for personnel training and developing, allows for management reorganization, and enhances the planning system for human
resources. The use of succession planning leads to an increased chance of internal succession and a reduced chance of forced
succession. Managers that do not have a plan risk losing the organization’s collective knowledge and culture. This is an on-going
research project and we will review the status of our research to date. A goal of our presentation is to explore what specific strategies
are in place for succession planning at SUNY College at Old Westbury and what strategies may need to be developed.
Burden and Benefit of LMS Migration
A migration from one Learning Management System to another has an important impact on the students' learning as well as on
educators' teaching. This presentation investigates how SUNY Old Westbury's students and faculty experience the migration from
angel to blackboard. Will we officially be ready for this migration in the fall of 2014? How can we benefit from this burden? This
study has observed and collected cases by interacting with faculty and students. This study will disseminate the top ten burdens and
benefits to ease some of the blackboard users.

Students for Social Justice Then and Now: Two Forms of Student Activism on Campus
In the mid-1970s, within a few years of the College's founding, two sets of interests collided at SUNY Old Westbury. New York State
and SUNY officials had to respond to a statewide budget crisis and pressures from Long Island legislators to change the nontraditional
character, population, and academic curricula at the College. The analysis of the origins of the Mission and early struggles to defend it
places Old Westbury's pursuit of social justice in historical perspective, demonstrating the role dedicated students and faculty played
in preserving that mission for future generations. While the college has changed in many ways, faculty and students continue to find
innovative ways to carry the Mission forward, as demonstrated in the collaborative research of C-SPACE on socio-economic
inequities.

Teaching the Digital Humanities
The growing presence of digital materials, available with a click via laptop, cell phone and myriad other devices, presents
opportunities and challenges for faculty in humanities disciplines. Games, oral histories and archives--to name just a few such
projects--make materials available for student and researcher as never before, but such materials pose real pedagogical challenges for
creator and user. Presenters discuss their experiences in developing student-friendly materials for use in the classroom at Old
Westbury.

An Interdisciplinary Approach to the Study of Social Inequality
This presentation is a natural fit with the mission of SUNY College at Old Westbury. The interdisciplinary focus on various social
issues allows an intentional discussion of how to best use research and practice to focus on issues of social justice. The diverse
approaches that are covered in this presentation will be useful for many different disciplines. The range of specific areas of emphasis
and research approaches will be beneficial to anyone doing research with disparities and/ or social justice issues.

B3. Would you tell us how we can improve the New Faculty Orientation?
That was a while ago. I don't really remember too many details, but I do remember thinking it
was fairly good overall.
Include more info about the tenure process
It would be helpful to have more written materials, such as a handbook on what should be
included in syllabi, etc. Contact information and frequently asked questions such as email and
computer support, reserving space, and resources available to instructors (library, career
services, tutoring, etc.) would be great to include.
I attended the administration's orientation, but I think the TLRC did a separate event, right?
Give a book-- as a present-- to every new faculty member.
I thought it should have been much sooner. I also felt a bit overwhelmed since I was getting so
much information all at once and I hadn't gotten any of it before the semester started. Of
course, having a two-day orientation might be problematic for others, but new faculty probably
won't put up much of a fuss since they're new and likely itching for information.

D3. Could you tell us how we could improve the Annual Faculty Conference (Schedule, themes,
logistics etc)?
I didn't attend the conference because it was scheduled on a very busy week at the end of the
semester. I'd be more likely to attend and/or present at the conference if it were held at an earlier
point in the spring semester. I also think it might have a bigger impact on our teaching practices if it
were held earlier in the semester so we could potentially implement strategies we've learned from
each other.
It took place during what is, for many departments, the busiest week of the semester and so I was
unfortunately unable to attend.
It was really well-organized but it's a very busy time of year and I missed many interesting sessions.
Maybe it could be split in two or held in the fall instead? Or done as regular Friday afternoon roundtables with one panel each and socializing afterwards?
It would be nice to hold the conference earlier in the semester so that more faculty can participate. I
enjoyed the theme for this year. Perhaps we could continue with themes around social justice,
student engagement, etc. for future conferences.
I didn't go so cannot comment.
I wrote comments on that survey.
It is a well-thought academic activity. Better food and a glass of wine would help.
Can you hold the event during a different week in April? I so much wanted to attend, but the week it
was scheduled was over-full--Monday was SAS Research Day which required quite a bit of time and
effort Wednesday was the Alumni Dinner which we always attend Thursday was Honors
Convocation which requires a lot of prep on our part so that our presentation goes smoothly These
combined with various end of the semester departmental responsibilities and deadlines made it
impossible to attend on that Friday.
Perhaps the TLRC and faculty senate need to figure out how can we effectively increase
participation in this particular event. The roundtables were very well attended. Overall an
outstanding job by the TLRC all year round.
I thought it was a really good event. I was somewhat disappointed by the number of faculty who
where in attendance being so low; but I am not sure that had anything to do with planning.
However, with such few faculty in attendance, the two separate tracks made it so that there were
even fewer people to be part of discussions. Again, there really is no easy way to get around that
since the conference would have been way too long otherwise. The time-keepers did not do the
best at keeping the conference on track.

E. Comments and Suggestions
E1. In your opinion, what are major pedagogical challenges at SUNY Old Westbury?
Engaging students! Many of them work a lot more hours than they should and don't get the irony that
they are working to pay for something they are not actually doing, like attending classes or doing their
schoolwork! The incredible diversity in their backgrounds and skills...
Students are not self-motivated; even seniors and 'good students' seem to always do the bare minimum
at the last minute, showing little or no evidence of interest or curiosity. There is also a persistent
problem of students not knowing skills that they should know, given course prerequisites.
Keeping high standards while providing good support for struggling students
Fostering community in the classroom by using collaborative learning. Some students are clearly used to
the banking model of education and are reluctant to take ownership of their education. They fail to see
that they can learn from their peers through small group activities and class discussion. It can be really
hard to motivate these students to want to learn, to engage with the course content, and to be "present"
(i.e. coming to class having done the reading and being prepared to participate fully).
Our students desperately need to build their writing and critical thinking skills and yet there is no support
to help them do this.
Encouraging students to read for real understanding and learning, and getting them to develop their
ideas in coherent ways, so they are ready for the complexities of the work force.
Developing good student writing and promoting reading/ critical reading are significant challenges.
Motivating students and having a wide range of abilities, interests, skills within the same class.
Reading and time.
Students' lack of feeling meaningful connection between what they are being taught and problems/ goals
that concern them.
Diversity of student skills.
Student often are working outside of school many hours, and are often late, absent and overworked.
Engaging students and the use of technology.
Individually, faculty are great people. But there is no sense of community among faculty. We need a
faculty Center, and engaged individuals. I should also say that the TLC Committee-- and its work-- is a
great antidote for faculty apathy.
Balancing Prof. Dev. and Service with teaching
Keeping current in pedagogical strategies to reach the students of the current (techno) generation
Classroom management
Since there isn't a vision from the top it falls on the faculty, as individuals to encourage a culture of
scholarship and true mentorship that is collegial.
Facilitating student reading and doing work outside of the classroom in of the hours they spend at their
jobs.
Students seem to have a feeling that being late or absent often is acceptable. Many of the students
seem to operate at e High School level rather than a college level, so classes must be adjusted to meet
that.
Classroom management. Managing the high-achieving students and lower achievers at the same time.
The students are used to being taught "down" to. I would like to meet them where they are and
challenge them to go above and beyond that by the end of the semester in a sort of Vygotsky scaffolding
sense. However, when many of them are accustomed to passing classes with minimal effort, my
methods produce polarization. Half of them realize what I am doing and appreciate that I care and the
other half simply hate me.

E2. What kind of workshops and events would you like TLRC to sponsor in order to enhance
your teaching and learning experience at Old Westbury?
More hands on workshops on topics . I want to know what kinds of new instructional
technologies are out there and how to use them, like using Pinterest or setting up wikis or if
any one has tried "flipping" classrooms? Has anyone tried videotaping their lectures? how did
it work? I want to hear more from people about alternative ways to assess learning, what
has worked and what hasn't ..
Workshops by senior faculty who have demonstrated success in the classroom.
I enjoyed the workshops that I attended this year and appreciate the work the TLRC is doing.
My main suggestion is to incorporate a practical component to all of these workshops. I'd
love to hear other faculty talk about strategies they use to foster community in their
classrooms using collaborative learning strategies. I'd also be eager to hear more about how
faculty manage gender expectations in the classroom.
Anything focused on practical teaching in the classroom.
Maybe a few targeted workshops on issues in Blackboard, like managing the gradebook, etc,
to help relieve anxieties
Workshops on how to include the mission in any discipline, and more detailed workshops on
developing student writing.
I could not go to all the ones held this year but I thought the topics were great and would like
to see "re-runs" of the ones I couldn't go to (and the ones I could.)
Topics connected with potential learning goals for General Education: internationalization,
technological literacy, contemplative studies, environmental justice.
This year's were great; you could probably repeat and expand some of them.
Creative assessment strategies
Learning more about using social media to connect with students and enhance course
material.
Model classes by best instructors.
Current pedagogical techniques for an active classroom
Invite outside experts that can demonstrate strategies that may engage active learning. Invite
students to participate in them. Include students in discussions on pedagogy and teachin.
More about getting uninterested students interested
See above.[ Classroom management. Managing the high-achieving students and lower
achievers at the same time.]
How to deal with the fact that students do not like to rely on research findings or common
theories in the field but instead on their own anecdotal experiences, even when taking
exams.
What others have done to overcome the age/gender/ethnicity challenges that may be present
with young faculty and students who perceive a lack of credibility.
Workshops that close the knowledge gap for junior faulty in the appointment/tenure process.
Or even promotion after tenure. I spoke to a group of individuals who had all been Associate
Professors for years and neither of them had a clue how to become a Professor.

E3. Please share your ideas for possible topics of the next year's Common Hour Roundtable
sessions.
The Round tables are good, but wish they could be more focussed, and more structured,
so we can really learn how to do specific things...as I said above...learn how to do portfolio
assessment or learning how to set up better powerpoints etc.
Hybrid courses that actually work.
What do students find to be engaging in the classroom?
What do students expect from their course work?
See above.[ I enjoyed the workshops that I attended this year and appreciate the work the
TLRC is doing. My main suggestion is to incorporate a practical component to all of these
workshops. I'd love to hear other faculty talk about strategies they use to foster community
in their classrooms using collaborative learning strategies. I'd also be eager to hear more
about how faculty manage gender expectations in the classroom.]
--teaching sentence-level writing issues
--engaging disinterested or unmotivated students
Moving students beyond Wikipedia
Helping students to take ownership of their learning process
Sessions on methods of promoting reading, how to improve writing.
1. See above.[ Learning more about using social media to connect with students and
enhance course material.]
2. Creating teamwork
3. Experiemtial learning methods
4. Creating a rubric
Have faculty who have authored books to talk about them-- no more than half hour please.
Mindfulness as teachers and colleagues
getting uninterested students interested
handling students with absence and lateness issues

E4. Comments / Suggestions
This is agreat idea
Thank you
Thanks for the work that you do!
Just want to add that I have really enjoyed the few roundtable discussions that I
attended. It would be nice to have a longer time to have these discussions as well as a
larger room.
This year's conference was excellent--serious in content and helpful in terms of
pedagogy and strategies in the classroom
This may not fit, but it would be great to have sessions on improving student
community/ engagement on campus, and ideas for integrating that into coursework.
Thanks!
I thought this year's program was great - and the topics selected were serious (not
condescending) and worth discussion.
Thanks for all your hard work. Sorry I missed most of the sessions, difficult semester.
I did attend a session about women in the classroom, was that you?
TLRC had a very good year and contributed a lot to the campus community. Thank
you for your work!
The quality and focus of this year's roundtables was excellent and made an important
contribution to college life.
Great job!!!
