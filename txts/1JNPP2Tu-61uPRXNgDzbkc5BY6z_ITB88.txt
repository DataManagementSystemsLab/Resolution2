Judith:
I thank you and all of our colleagues at Old Westbury for your continued support.
Media coverage on our response to DeRussy has flushed out many crazies who make

personal attacks on our union and its officers. Your action is greatly appreciated and
should help in our quest to bring sanity and reason to the Board of Trustees.
Thank you.
Bill Scheuerman

I am forwarding a hard copy of the following letter sent today to Bill Scheuerman

Dear Bill:

As secretary of Old Westbury's Faculty Senate, I am writing to informyou that the _
faculty discussed the UUP resolution made after Candace deRussy's comments were
published in Newsday this month. The outcome ofour discussion follows.
At its February 15th Faculty meeting, the SUNY/Old Westbury faculty voted to endorse
the UUP resolution, dated February 9, 2002, that condemns Trustee de Russy's comments

about academic Black Studies Programs. The vote was 34-4-0.

Furthermore, at the same meeting, the faculty passed the following resolution by a vote
of 35-2-1:
Whereas, Candace de Russy's research was lax in failing to note that the Black Studies
program she attacks at SUNY/Old Westbury does not exist, although we agree that one
should, we strongly support the UUP resolution.
Yours truly,
