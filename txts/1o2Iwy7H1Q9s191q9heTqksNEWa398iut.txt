Resolution

in support of President Calvin O, Butts, Ill,’s

speech at SUNY College at Old Westbury, October 9,
2002

The faculty of Old Westbury supports, underscores and endorses the inspiring and
compelling comments made by President Calvin O. Butt, III (October 9, 2002) regarding
the need for peaceful solutions to the volatile, escalating call for war on Iraq and beyond.
We urge that faculty, students and staff commit themselves to work, teach and

stand for peace in the tradition of Old Westbury.
In this spirit, we urge that all faculty attend and encourage their classes to attend
the forthcoming teach-in’s during Common Hours on the U.S. military campaign
targeting Iraq.
