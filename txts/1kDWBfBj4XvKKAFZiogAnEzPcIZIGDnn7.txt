Resolution on Elections to the Executive Committee

Additional (2nd) At Large Representative to the EC and Expansion of Eligibility Criteria



Background

The Executive Committee (EC) of the Faculty Senate, described under Article V (sections C−G) of the current Faculty Bylaws (2016 edition), consists of the following: 

The officers of the Faculty Senate (Chair, Vice Chair, and Secretary/Treasurer) who are members of the Senate holding academic rank, elected by the Senate to one-year term (renewable to a maximum of four years); 

The SUNY Faculty Senator, elected by the Faculty and Professional Staff (to a renewable 3-year term);

The Faculty Parliamentarian, appointed by the Chair of Faculty Senate; and

One Senator elected by and from the Senate, referred to as the “At-Large Representative to the EC” 



The composition of the Senate and the process by which constituencies elect their “Senate representatives”, also referred to as “Senators”, are described under Article V section B. Voting membership is composed of: 

One representative from each academic department, elected by voting faculty of each department; 

5 representatives elected by the voting faculty of each School, referred to as “Senators At Large”; 

3 professionals elected by the non-management confidential professional employees, referred to as UUP Professionals; 

3 students elected through student government, referred to as SGA Senators; and 

The chairs of standing committees, who serve ex officio as voting members the Senate.  



Alternates are described under Article V section B (item 8), which states:  “For each of the preceding Senators, an alternate (sic) shall be elected by the same procedures to serve in the absence of the Senator”. An alternate may vote only in the absence of the Senator. 



Non-voting ex officio members of the Senate, as described under Article V section B (items 10-12) include: the President of the College, the College Vice Presidents and the Deans. 



In Fall 2020, the Senate considered a motion to temporarily suspend Faculty Bylaws Article V section G, on the composition of the EC. Without dissent, the Senate approved pro tem the election of an additional (second) At Large Representative to the Executive Committee, with responsibilities to include technology and electronic media. A statement from the Parliamentarian, dated September 11, 2020, also provided a rationale in support of the additional At Large Representation on the EC, citing precedents and evolving roles of governance. 



In the early years of Faculty Senate, UUP Professionals were eligible to serve on the EC, and during the 2000’s, “Visiting” full-time faculty with longstanding service to the college also served on the EC. Current Bylaws limit election to the EC to Senators holding academic rank. Eligibility for nomination and election to the EC has not, to date, ever been extended to alternates. Although there have been instances, in the past two decades, of alternates, contingent faculty and professionals volunteering to serve as “note-takes” when no other Senator was willing to be nominated to serve as Secretary/Treasurer, these temporary “note-takers” did not serve on the EC.   



During the three decades of our representative governance structure, eligibility criteria for nomination and election to the Executive Committee has been codified under the Faculty Bylaws, as approved by a vote of the full Faculty. Any consideration by the Senate of a motion to temporarily suspend a specific Article/section of the Bylaws would have authority as part of Senate’s deliberative legislative processes. However, such actions by the Senate resulting in pro tem changes are subject to subsequent review by the Bylaws Working Group for the vetting of potential amendments to the Faculty Bylaws.

Resolution on Elections to the Executive Committee

Additional (2nd) At Large Representative to the EC and Expansion of Eligibility Criteria



Whereas, under current Faculty Bylaws, the Executive Committee (EC) of Faculty Senate consists of the elected Senate officers (Chair, Vice Chair and Secretary/Treasurer) who are members of the Senate holding academic rank, the SUNY Faculty Senator, the Parliamentarian, and one At Large Representative to the EC elected by and from the Senate; and,   



Whereas, in recent decades, the college has expanded undergraduate programs and graduate degrees and such growth, as well as increased SUNY mandates, have increased responsibilities through shared governance; and



Whereas, during three decades of our Senate governance structure, as the college has grown through new undergraduate programs and graduate degrees and the number of faculty full-time equivalents (FTE) has increased by about 50%, with such growth corresponding to an increase in Faculty Senate responsibilities through shared governance, the EC has been comprised of six persons, under Article V (Section G) of Faculty Bylaws; and



Whereas, during years of college growth and increased use of technology, the Executive Committee has taken on appropriate additional responsibilities above and beyond those codified in current Bylaws, including the upkeep of the Faculty Senate Website and electronic publishing of Senate and Faculty documents on the website; and,

 

Whereas, in Fall 2020, the Senate approved temporary suspension of Article V (Section G) to elect a second At-Large Representative to the Executive Committee pro tem whose responsibilities include technology and electronic media; and,



Whereas, due to Covid-related measures since mid-Spring 2020, the Executive Committee has hosted and conducted Senate and Faculty meetings remotely, including provisions for electronic/remote voting, and demand remains high for the foreseeable future for the continued remote availability of meetings and voting; and



Whereas, throughout the pandemic when remote attendance has been available, many Senators as well as Alternates have attended meetings on a regular basis and acquired relevant Senate experience; and



Whereas, under Faculty Bylaws, eligibility to serve on the Executive Committee has not been extended to Alternates during three decades of our representative governance structure, though UUP Professionals and contingent faculty (with full-time “Visiting” status) did serve on the EC in the 1990’s and 2000’s; and,   



Whereas, during the past two decades, in those years when no eligible Senator was willing to be nominated to serve as Secretary/Treasurer, temporary “note-takers” in the Senate volunteered to serve on a monthly basis or for a portion of a semester, and some “note-takers” including contingent faculty and UUP Professionals as well as Alternates not eligible under Bylaws to serve on the Executive Committee; therefore



Be It Resolved, that Faculty Senate approve the temporary suspension of relevant sections of Faculty Bylaws Article V to adopt the following pro tem changes to EC composition and eligibility criteria: 

The election of a second At-Large Representative to serve on the Executive Committee, whose responsibilities include technology and electronic media, as pro tem change to Article V section G.

The expansion of EC eligibility criteria to include any elected Senator, or any Alternate in attendance, for nomination and election to the roles of Secretary/Treasurer and the two At-Large Representatives on the Executive Committee, as pro tem changes to Article V Section D and Section B (item 8) on alternates.



Therefore Be It Further Resolved, that Faculty Senate recommend to the Bylaws Working Group, in the upcoming five-year review of the Bylaws, the vetting of the following potential amendments to the Faculty Bylaws, under Article V:

The establishment of an additional (second) At Large Representative to the Executive Committee, with responsibilities to include technology and electronic media. 

The potential expansion of eligibility to serve on the Executive Committee, by consideration of the eligibility of contingent faculty, UUP professionals, and Alternates.
