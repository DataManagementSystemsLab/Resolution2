Masks, Ventilation & Vaccines
• Masks:
• Currently required of State
employees indoors/outdoors
whether vaccinated or not.

• Campuses for the summer can
determine whether masks are
required for all, especially when
social distancing cannot be achieved.
• Campus constituents have the right
and ability to choose to wear a mask
if they feel it appropriate/necessary.

• Those vaccinated (students and
employees) will be exempt from weekly
COVID-19 testing
• Some surveillance testing of vaccinated
campus members may still be required.
Final decision pending.
• Mandated student vaccines are not in
place yet:
• Requires action by SUNY Board of Trustees.
• Will be contingent on full approval of a
vaccine by the FDA.

• HR is working on a process to request
employees to volunteer vaccine status
(as it is not information we can require at
this time).
