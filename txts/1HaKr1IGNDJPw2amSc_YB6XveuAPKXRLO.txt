Section 2. Program Summary

In 300 or fewer words, describe the proposed program, including its purpose, content, structure and duration.
Black Studies offers a multi and interdisciplinary major that encourages students to ask critical questions about the
diverse experiences of people of African descent and their relationship to the world. Through national, transnational
and diasporic perspectives, courses in Old Westbury’s Black Studies Program, enrich the liberal arts tradition and social
justice mission of the College, recognizing the varied histories, perspectives, identities, activism, and cultural productions
of African-descended peoples. Devoted to the breadth of experiences in the African diaspora, the degree provides
students with the critical tools to examine the intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, class, health, nation, art,
literature, ethnography, and politics. Through varied methodologies the major can assist students in developing new
methods for analyzing constructed narratives of the African Diaspora. A major in Black Studies an prepare students for
graduate programs in a variety of fields in the arts, humanities and social sciences and lead to a wide array of career
paths in education, public health, international relations, law, urban planning, archives, libraries, politics, and business.
The 120-credit degree program includes 4 required courses and 7 electives in the following categories: Humanities,
Literature and Arts, and Social Science. The required courses include introductory courses in African American Studies
and African American history, a course in Black Studies Humanities OR Social Black Studies Social science, and a directed
study senior seminar capstone course. Students will have considerable flexibility to drive the thematic focus of the
degree through elective course selection. The list of electives are listed in the curriculum map below and students will
be encouraged to meet with an advisor to plan their full program according to their personal interests.

Optional, Illustrative Questions to Consider:
For other SUNY campuses responding to the Program Announcement
● Do you have a similar or related program? ●What has been your experience with the program? ●Would the
introduction of this program have any effect, positive or negative, on your institution? If so, please specify. ●Do you
perceive a need for this kind of program? ●Does the program offer an opportunity for articulation or inter-institutional
cooperation?
Your response must be in writing, from your President, and addressed to the President of the proposing campus,
with a copy to the SUNY Provost at program.review@.suny.edu.
Procedure for Program Announcements (PA)
1. SCOPE. A SUNY campus must send a PA to the SUNY Provost at program.review@suny.edu before submitting
a proposal for a new program leading to an undergraduate degree. Unless requested by the SUNY Provost, a PA
is not required for a program leading to an undergraduate certificate, for a new program being created by
combining existing registered programs (e.g., multi-award programs and/or multi-institution programs), or for a
new program being created from a track, specialization, or concentration in a registered program.
2. SUNY PROVOST’S REVIEW. The SUNY Provost’s Office reviews each PA for accuracy and completeness as
well as for substantive issues, such as alignment with campus mission and SUNY policy, and requests changes
when needed.
3. PUBLICATION FOR COMMENTS. Once a PA is acceptable to the SUNY Provost, it is announced on the
SUNY Program Review listserv in a weekly Program Review Update, which starts a 30-day intra-SUNY
comment period. The listserv includes all campus presidents, chief academic officers, and others upon request.
The PA enables other SUNY campuses – particularly those with experience with related programs – to provide
information to the proposing campus that can be used to construct a sound program proposal.
4. COMMENTS FROM OTHER CAMPUSES. The President of each interested campus must send comments
within 30 days of a PA’s publication in the Program Review Update to the President of the proposing campus,
with a copy to the Provost at program.review@suny.edu. Comments may include advice and suggestions about
possible articulation opportunities, enrollment trends in related programs, and opportunities for cooperation, as
well as concerns or objections.
5. FOLLOWING THE COMMENT PERIOD. Once the 30-day comment period for a PA ends, and any concerns
and/or objections have been resolved, the campus may prepare a full proposal for the SUNY Provost and, when
required, begin the external evaluation process.
6. EXPIRATION. A PA expires one year after its publication in the Program Review Update. If the proposing
campus does not submit a program proposal to the SUNY Provost before a PA expires, the campus must submit
another PA to start the process again.
