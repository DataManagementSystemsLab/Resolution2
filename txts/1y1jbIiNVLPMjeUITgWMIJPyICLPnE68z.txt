Resolution for the Proposal for
Revisions to a Minor in Environmental Studies
WHEREAS, a group of faculty proposed to restructure an existing Minor in Environmental
Studies, and
WHEREAS, the existing curriculum of the Minor was designed when fewer courses on this
topic were offered at the College and needs updating, and
WHEREAS, the revised, five-course curriculum draws courses from a broader range of
disciplines and is designed to introduce students to studies of environment issues in
Natural Sciences, Social Sciences and Humanities, and
WHEREAS, the revised program eliminates courses that are no longer routinely offered or
departments no longer want to include in the Minor, and
WHEREAS, the revised program consists of a required course from a History & Philosophy
and elective courses offered by American Studies, Biological Studies, Chemistry &
Physics, English, Psychology, Politics, Economics & Law, Public Health, and Sociology,
and
WHEREAS, all Academic Departments that would contribute a course/courses to a revised
program expressed their support for the revisions, and
WHEREAS, the History and Philosophy Department expressed willingness to house this
Minor, and
WHEREAS, the proposed revisions require no additional resources,

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Faculty Senate approve the proposed revisions in
a Minor in Environmental Studies.

Proposal Statement for Revisions to the Environmental Studies Minor
1. Title: Environmental Studies minor
Housing Department: History and Philosophy
2. Purpose of Revision: The previous minor was established when there were fewer courses
focused on environmental topics at Old Westbury. Many more courses today fit into the
minor, and the elective content reflects both an increase in interdisciplinary offerings and
an elimination of courses from the curriculum that are no longer routinely offered or
departments no longer want to include in the minor. With History & Philosophy starting
to offer an Environmental Studies major (spring 2022), the revisions also harmonize
some of the structure (same required course) between the major and minor.
3. Changes in Curriculum:
a. Required course changed:
i. HI 3001 Introduction to Environmental Studies
ii. NO LONGER: BS2490 Environmental Science OR BS4470 Ecology
AND BS4680 Environmental Health
b. Eliminates the required independent study
c. Requires interdisciplinary coursework
d. More clearly points out how many classes can overlap with students’ major
4. Changes in Instruction:
a. New elective courses:
i. HI 3001 Intro to Environmental Studies
ii. EL 2233 Environmental Literature
iii. AS 2300 Problems in US Environmental History
iv. AS 2750 Food
v. HI2810 Geography, Earth, and People
vi. HI3001 Intro to Environmental Studies
vii. HI3003 Environments in World History I
viii. HI3005 Environments in World History II
ix. HI3120 Latin America: Environment and Society
x. HI3600 Global Geography: People, Places & Environments
xi. HI3700 Historical Geography of Latin America
xii. HI4600 World Regional Geography
xiii. HI4700 Modern Global Environments
xiv. PE4280 Environmental Politics
xv. PE4290 Environmental Economics
xvi. PH4890 Environmental Justice
b. Removed courses:
i. PE3720 Long Island Economy, Environment and Society
ii. BS3530 Comparative Genomics Lecture
iii. BS3531 Comparative Genomics Lab
iv. BS3710 Environmental Physiology
v. BS4680 Environmental Health
vi. BS5591 Environmental Research

vii. CP2000/2001 Chemistry for Non-Majors with Lab
viii. PY3520 Environmental Psychology
ix. PH4680 Environmental Health
5. Changes in Resources: N/A
6. Changes in Administration: housed in History and Philosophy

Proposed Revisions to Catalog Description
The Environmental Studies Minor examines the relationship between people and
their environment, the physical and biological sciences, and important environmental
issues. Students analyze historical and contemporary environmental problems by taking courses
in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Students might pursue this minor
in preparation for a career in environmental research, education, activism, policy or law, among
others.
This five-course interdisciplinary minor introduces students to environmental ideas as
represented in the Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, and Humanities.
1. Students take Introduction to Environmental Studies (Column A),
2. At least one course in the Natural Sciences (Column B)
3. At least one class in the Social Sciences/Humanities (Column C)
4. The remaining two elective classes selected from any offerings in Columns B and C
5. At least two courses in the minor must be upper division (one of which will be HI 3001
Intro to Environmental Studies).
6. Only one course from the student’s major can be double counted in the minor.
7. Internships and independent studies should be in a student’s field of study and/or
approved by an Affiliated faculty advisor.
A. Required Course: (4 credits):
 HI 3001 Intro to Environmental Studies
B. Students must take a minimum of one (4 credit) of the following elective courses:
 BS2490 Environmental Science
 BS3450 Plant Biology
 BS4470 Ecology
 BS4472 Microbial Ecology
 BS4491 Human Ecology

Current Catalog Description
Students interested in environmental issues may enhance their knowledge of the interaction of
humans with their environment by minoring in Environmental Studies. This interdisciplinary
course of studies exposes the student to both environmental sciences as practiced in biology and
chemistry, as well as policy issues, which are explored from a social science perspective.
Students who are majoring in the natural sciences may wish to pursue this minor in preparation
for a career in environmental research. Students in the Social Sciences and Humanities may want
to broaden their knowledge of environmental issues in preparation for a career involving
environmental policy or law. Direct participation in environmental agencies and organizations on
Long Island or independent laboratory research on an environmental problem is an important
aspect of this minor.
Students minoring in Environmental Studies are required to complete five courses (20 credits),
distributed as follows:
A. Required Courses (8 credits)
4. BS2490 Environmental Science or BS4470 Ecology
5. BS4680 Environmental Health. (fyi <-- not offered frequently at all! (also, currently
under PH’s ownership)
B. An independent study taken under the auspices of one of the following (4 credits)
 AS4832 Internship in Journalism
 BS5591 Environmental Research
 CP5900 Research
 PH4900 Health and Society Field Placement
 PE5999 Internship
