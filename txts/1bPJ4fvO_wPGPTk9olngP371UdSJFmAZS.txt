New Year.
The Nowruz Concert Features
Amir Vahab and his Ensemble.

The New York Times calls Amir Vahab the "ambassador for a silenced
music." Honored as a peacemaker and virtuoso, Amir Vahab is one of
New Yorkâ€™s most celebrated and distinguished composer/vocalist of
Sufi and folk music. The virtuoso of Amir weaves fiery instrumentals

and songs of the historic lands of the Middle East and Central Asia. His
work transcends political boundaries while maintaining traditional
sensibilities in a way few artists can manage. Amir Vahab's music is
rooted in tradition but has been influenced by contemporary sounds.
Like Amir himself, his music symbolizes diversity-in-unity.
His performances have been recognized worldwide and have inspired
many music students. Amir Vahab is currently teaching and lecturing
private and group classes in universities, libraries, museums and
cultural centers. He also organizes music therapy and sound healing
workshops.
