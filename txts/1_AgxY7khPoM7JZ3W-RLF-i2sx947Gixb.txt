Resolution on the STEM Building Addition and Renovation Project

Whereas, enrollment at SUNY College at Old Westbury has been growing each year, with the largest student body in the history of the college in this academic year 2019-2020, and

Whereas, existing instructional and research space in the Natural Sciences Building is limited, and is unable to meet current demand, and

Whereas, a large proportion of classes held in the Natural Sciences Building have enrollment that is overtallied to classroom or lab capacity, and thus students majoring in STEM fields will continue to experience waitlists in required courses, prolonging their time to graduation, and

Whereas, the hiring of new STEM faculty to meet the demand of increased enrollment has resulted in challenges in allocating very limited faculty support space for teaching and research labs, and

Whereas, SUNY College at Old Westbury continues to develop new degree programs in STEM such as Bachelor of Science degree programs in Bioinformatics and Physics, in order to support student demand and the needs of the workforce, and

Whereas, projected headcounts from 2018 to 2028 are expected to increase 41.3% in Biological Sciences, 26.5% in Public Health, and 32.0% in Chemistry/Physics majors, from a total of 1,815 students to 3,452 students, as verified by the Provost in the 2016 Program Study for the Natural Sciences Building, and

Whereas, to house this number of incoming students would require an additional 9 classrooms and 12 class labs, and

Whereas, the current Natural Sciences Building has ongoing and recurrent issues with mold and leaks, rendering some spaces unusable and creating health hazards for faculty, staff, and students who occupy this building, and

Whereas, most classrooms in the Natural Sciences Building require technological and functional updates, including but not limited to repair of broken blinds, projectors, and desks, and

Whereas, there is limited flexible and collaborative teaching and research space in the current Natural Sciences Building, which limits the ability of faculty to implement new and evolving pedagogies that focus more on multi-disciplinary and interactive learning modes, and

Whereas, the project proposal was initially proposed to the State in 2015 as the first component of the Sciences Building Addition & Renovation, and

Whereas, project pre-design was initiated in 2016, and a detailed building plan was submitted to SUNY in March of 2019,

Therefore, be it resolved that the proposed STEM Building Addition and Renovation project is recognized as a critical first step in addressing the Collegeâ€™s most urgent space limitations,

And be it further resolved that the Faculty Senate urges that the planned STEM Building Addition and Renovation project is considered a priority in upcoming campus improvements, and advocates for the SUNY Chancellor to support this project by requesting the Governor allocate funds immediately.
