Resolution to Require the Explicit Inclusion and Identification of a “Social Justice Component” in Every
Academic Program
Whereas, the College’s mission articulates the following, “Old Westbury weaves the values of integrity,
community engagement, and global citizenship into the fabric of its academic programs and campus life.
In an environment that cultivates critical thinking, empathy, creativity and intercultural understanding, we
endeavor to stimulate a passion for learning and a commitment to building a more just and sustainable
world,” and
Whereas, the current curriculum, as described in the Undergraduate and Graduate Bulletins does not
explicitly identify any particular “social justice components,” and
Whereas, the identity of the College to its students, faculty and staff, as well as to the universe of potential
students, and within SUNY, does not emphasize the social justice qualities central to the College’s
mission, and
Whereas, the SUNY Student Opinion Survey of spring 2012 indicates that Old Westbury is failing to
graduate students who exemplify the College’s mission, and
Whereas, the historical reliance on “informal” means to incorporate social justice into the curriculum has
failed in establishing social justice as an integral component in the educational experience for students,
and this failure is likely to be further exacerbated by factors related to the implementation of seamless
transfer, and
Whereas, only through the conscious, intentional and explicit insertion of a “social justice component”
into each individual academic department’s curriculum can the College live up to its mission and make
real its rhetoric, and
Whereas, the nature and quality of individual disciplines requires that the ways in which the social justice
mission of the College might best be articulated in those disciplines will vary;
Therefore Be It Resolved, That every academic department shall identify and establish an explicit and
integrated “social justice component” in the curriculum for every major, minor or certificate program
sponsored or offered by that academic department, and
Be it Further Resolved, That each such “social justice component” meet a college-wide standard to be
established and monitored by the Curriculum and Academic Planning Committee, and
Be it Further Resolved, That such requirements be explicitly identified as such in major and program
descriptions, and
Be it Further Resolved, That the Academic Deans and the Provost shall foster and facilitate the inclusion
of a “social justice component” in each academic major, program or certificate, including appropriate
resources and staffing.
