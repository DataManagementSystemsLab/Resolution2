At-Large Representative

The Faculty Senate elects one Senator each year to represent the body to the Executive
Committee. The At-Large Representative serves as a liaison between the members of the
Senate, individually and collectively, and the Executive Committee.
The At-Large Representative may bring to the attention of the Executive Committee
concerns and/or suggestions arising from other Senators. In addition to attending bi-

weekly meetings of the Executive Committee in order to set the agenda for Senate and
Faculty meetings, the At-Large Representative may also attend other meetings, as needed,
related to Executive Committee activities.

The At-Large Representative may volunteer (or be asked by the Chair) to take on specific

assignments or projects related to the work of the Executive Committee or the Senate. Any
voting member of the Senate is eligible to serve as the At-Large Representative for a term
of one year
