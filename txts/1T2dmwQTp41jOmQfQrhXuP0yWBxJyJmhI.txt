Subject: A bit more budget information
To: UFSCGLS@ls.sysadm.suny.edu


Colleagues,

A couple of weeks ago, the Board of Trustees Finance and Administration
Committee was presented with some sobering information about the impact of
the Executive budget on SUNY campuses. The charts I'm attaching give
considerable weight to the need for SUNY to do a lot better by the
Legislature than we did by the Governor. And in light of what I sent you
earlier, I thought I should share these three charts with you. The first
shows the impact of the TAPTAX, as Old Westbury has characterized it. It is
worth noting, however, that the tuition credit expires/sunsets with the end
of NYSUNY 2020--which is to say that, after 2015-16, SUNY will be under no
legal obligation to provide any money to students to cover the difference
between TAP awards and SUNY tuition--quite simply shafting those for whom
SUNY has been covering this difference over a 5-year period. The second
slide shows the costs of salary increases, the tuition credit, and the
additional complication for 2015-16 of an extra pay period (because of when
our two-week checks hit with respect to end-of-year calendar). It shows the
costs on the + axis, and the shortfall on the - axis (i.e. even tuition
doesn't cover all of the costs). Note that the projections beyond next year
are without any new tuition increases and without any new salary increases.
Finally, the last slide--the most sobering of all--shows the projected net
effect of the Governor's budget on the State dollars coming to the
campuses. You can do the math if you want, but clearly without a
significant infusion of new funds--whether from higher enrollments or State
tax dollars--most of our campuses will be facing deficits, some
significant, next year. And that's in total dollars, not percentage
shortfall (which obviously will be much higher for small campuses than the
large ones).

I know it's not pretty, and it's why we need to be as proactive as possible-
-and why UUP has been doing so, and why System Administration has been
doing so.

Pete
