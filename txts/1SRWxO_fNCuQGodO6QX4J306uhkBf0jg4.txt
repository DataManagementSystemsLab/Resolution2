I am writing in an attempt to clear up possible confusion about a
graduation reception.

A question was raised at the Full Faculty meeting regarding a graduation
reception and

Dr. Oâ€™Sullivan responded that we would have one.  However, he was referring
to the Faculty

Appreciation Reception, which will be held on Tuesday, May 19, 2015
beginning at 6pm.

     The Student Government Association, historically, had sponsored a
student/parent reception

following the Commencement ceremony.  However, this was not continued due
to lack of funding,

and has not been held for several years.  The College then introduced two
ceremonies- one in the

morning and one in the afternoon, in an effort to provide students with a
larger number of tickets.

     It has been brought to my attention that some departments are planning
to hold individual

receptions following Commencement.  The college cannot permit departmental
receptions on

Commencement day.  There are challenges in moving people off campus, with
enough time to

comfortably clear the campus before the next group of graduation candidates
and their guests arrive.

     I must ask that if you have scheduled a departmental event on the day
of commencement that

you reschedule it for a different day.



     Thank you for your cooperation
