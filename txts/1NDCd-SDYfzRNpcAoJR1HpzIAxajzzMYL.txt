additional funding.

college, looking at our budget, where costs can be cut, he is encouraged by Mr.
Davis’s willingness to participate in this process.
-Many colleges are looking at ways to reduce costs.
-Dr. Butts met with Senator James Gaughran, asking for at least 5 million dollars to
complete new STEM building. Contacting our Senators, States Assembly,
Chancellor, and private corporation, we need 130 million. He believes it can be
done and is encouraged by his meeting with Senator Gaughran.

competition is increasing, forecast for fall enrollment is cloudy.

-Our goal is to grow by less that 2% on undergraduate level. Retention rates are key.
-Budget concerns and enrollment concerns. He is not seriously worried, but we will
continue to grow, his concern is, will our budget allow us to grow in the way we
want to grow. He believes next year we will have the money we need and be able to
sustain our efforts and take a lot of persuasion at all levels.
- He has gotten some reports that our students that have recently come to our college
are very happy with their choice and they are upbeat, and he is asking the faculty to
do all that we can to maintain that spirit and retain students.
-Maureen Dolan is trying to revive the green committee. Dr. Butts is in favor of this
especially in terms of building the new science building.
-He opens the floor up to questions:
-Question: Dream Act passing in new York might be an enormous source of students
for OW, DACA students are some of our strongest. But a lot of these high school
students do not apply to SUNY. At what point would be there be financial aid for
these students?
o These students tend to go to the community college when they could go to
better schools. The governor has it for his signature and yes DACA has
passed. It’s time we go out and promote.
-Question: Upgrading technology, we are a special needs school. We have an excellent
faculty and we really need money.
o The governor knows about our unique position. He has been here 6 or 7
times. We have considerable strength in the State Assembly. We are pressing
the issue all the time, our deteriorating conditions, our commitment to poor
students.
-Question: Are we still doing media outreach?
o the short answer is, yes.
-Enrollment is up so we can negotiate.

Provost Report
-Senior Vice Chancellor and SUNY Provost, Tod Laursen met with Dr. Butts and his
cabinet, students, and faculty governance leadership. We need the support of the
SUNY Provost to go into the Public Health area.
-Provost O’Sullivan thanks: Jacob Heller, Anthony Barbera, Margaret Torrell for all
their work on Middle States. There is a time line and we are doing very well.
-It is important that when documents are handed out you read and comment
-I hope you will convey to your colleagues that important of service. I see more and
more new faculty that are caught up in college service, we are asking people to
widen the net.
-Effectiveness of Common Hour? Jacob Heller will conduct a survey.
-Question: How can we provide incentives or awards to recognize faculty service? How
can we recognize senior faculty service?

Second Year. A collaborative effort between different departments. Contact Kaitlin
