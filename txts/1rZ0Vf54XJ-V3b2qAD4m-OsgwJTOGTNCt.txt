DSI: The AVP honored the faculty committee’s rankings on merit.

Equity rankings were

based on several criteria, including years in rank, years in service, and nationwide trends

in faculty salaries. Equity raises will be a lump sum; merit raises will be a percent of
salary.

Questions:
>
In response to questions about DSI, Dr. Bonnett explained that merit will be addressed
first, and equity increases will be distributed from funds remaining. No additional funds
will be added to the pool. Several Senators spoke against the plan to award merit raises
as a percent, a practice that compounds inequity, and a resolution was offered to urge
administrators to award lump sums instead. The resolution (attached) was approved
unanimously [17-0-0].
>
Dr. Bonnett elaborated on the budget situation, adding that he believes system
administration may be using the budget crisis to make unpopular decisions, that there
may be mid-year cuts and lost lines. He stressed that he will not willingly accept these
cuts. He noted that funds for EOP will be cut, including department tutoring funds.
>
Regarding psychological services for students in connection with the WTC attack ,
Student Health services are available, and the Psychology department will publicize the
willingness of faculty to provide assistance.

new minors are approved. Senate will devise a procedure for doing so.
>
A. Bonnett commended CAP on its work, but expressed his strenuous support for
external members on 5-year program reviews, which CAP has voted against. Senate will
take up this issue at a future meeting.
