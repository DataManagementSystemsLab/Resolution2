Resolution for Post-Graduation Awarding of Micro-Credentials to
Spring and Summer 2020 Graduates

WHEREAS, prior to Fall 2020, the College had no explicit policy concerning at which point a
new Micro-Credential programs take effect, and
WHEREAS, the College policy stipulates that only currently enrolled students may apply for
Micro-Credentials, and
WHEREAS, due to the lack of a clear policy, Spring and Summer 2020 graduates were not
granted an opportunity to apply for Micro-Credentials that were approved in
Spring 2020 while they were enrolled;

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Faculty Senate retroactively extend the Timing of
Activation provision in the Resolution for Micro-Credential Requirement Revisions
to the Micro-Credential programs approved by the Faculty Senate in Spring 2020,
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Faculty Senate approve awarding these MicroCredentials to Spring and Summer 2020 graduates who have fulfilled all
requirements for respective programs.
