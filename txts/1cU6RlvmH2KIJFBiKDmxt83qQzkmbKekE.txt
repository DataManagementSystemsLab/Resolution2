Resolution to Create an Ad Hoc Faculty Committee to Promote Anti-Racism Initiatives This Year (PARITY)
WHEREAS the Faculty Senate passed a resolution in June 2020 committing to a position of solidarity with the
Black Lives Matter movement; students, alumni, staff, and faculty of color; and continued efforts toward the
erasure of racial inequity and oppression; and
WHEREAS that resolution resolved that SUNY Old Westbury would dedicate the 2020-2021 Academic Year to
the curricular and co-curricular (e.g. dialogue or lecture series, panel discussions, teach-in) exploration of topics
related to racial (in)equity, (in)justice, and movements for social change; and
WHEREAS faculty and staff are currently organizing an array of different initiatives related to the spirit of this
resolution and to challenging racism on campus and beyond, and faculty governance can only be strengthened
by creating a formal space for these efforts; and
WHEREAS the work of anti-racism initiatives often falls on faculty and staff of color, whose important labor
might go unrecognized for purposes of reappointment, promotion, and tenure unless they are serving on a
formally constituted committee;
Therefore be it
RESOLVED that an Ad Hoc Faculty Committee to Promote Anti-Racism Initiatives be constituted to:
•
•

•
•

Gather and disseminate information on faculty- and administration-led anti-racism initiatives at SUNY
Old Westbury and within the SUNY system;
Identify and implement initiatives to advance the June 2020's dedication of this academic year to a
curricular and co-curricular exploration of topics related to racial (in)equity, (in)justice, and movements
for social change;
Advocate for support for relevant initiatives from the administration;
Collaborate with key stakeholders on campus and within the SUNY system, such as the Student
Government Association, the administration, the SUNY Black Faculty and Staff Collective, University
Faculty Senate, UUP, CSEA, and others to identify and implement anti-racism initiatives; and, be it
further

RESOLVED that the membership of the Ad Hoc PARITY committee shall consist of a minimum of five
members, drawn from faculty and staff, appointed by the Senate Chair with consent of the Senate. Committee
can add additional members as necessary to complete its work. To encourage maximum participation, all
meetings will be open to all in the campus community. Decisions will be made by consensus among all
attendees whenever possible. If the chair of the committee determines that a vote must be held, only formally
recognized members of the committee will be entitled to vote; and, be it further
RESOLVED that the Ad Hoc PARITY Committee shall be charged to recommend to the Faculty Senate such
policies and procedures as it deems suitable for the success and continued development of initiatives pertinent
to the June 2020 resolution, and, be it further
RESOLVED that the Senate shall assess the continued role for this Ad Hoc committee in early fall 2021,
including determining whether a continued need for this type of work might justify a bylaws revision to
reconstitute this Ad Hoc committee as a standing committee in the future.
