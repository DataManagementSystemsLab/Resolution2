     Resolutionâ€”Combined B.A. in Spanish/M.A.T. in Spanish/ Adolescence
                                  Education

WHEREAS,    The School of Education has found significant  student  interest
          in a 5 year program that will result in  a  combined  Bachelor  of
          Arts  in  Spanish  and  Master  of  Arts  in   Teaching    Spanish
          /Adolescence Education, and

WHEREAS,    The proposed  5  year  program  revises  two  existing  programs
          (Bachelor of Arts in  Spanish  and  Master  of  Arts  in  Teaching
          Spanish/ Adolescence Education) into one 5 year combined  program,
          and

WHEREAS,    The proposed  5  year  combined  B.A./M.A.T  will  allow  highly
          qualified students to complete both a Bachelor of Arts  degree  in
          Spanish and a Master of  Arts  in  Teaching  Spanish/  Adolescence
          Education  degree  in  5  years  by   accelerating   undergraduate
          coursework and taking graduate courses in their 4th year of study,
          and

WHEREAS,    The proposed 5 year program consists entirely  of  courses  that
          are already offered in the School of Education curriculum and  the
          curriculum of other departments involved  in  this  program,  thus
          mitigating the need for any additional resources, and

WHEREAS,    The proposed 5 year program allows students to fulfill  the  New
          York State requirement of obtaining a Masters degree in  order  to
          qualify for their teaching certification, and

WHEREAS,    The School  of  Education  has  determined  that  students  with
          Masters degrees have a higher  passing  rate  on  New  York  State
          teaching certification examinations.


THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED

      That the Senate approves the proposed Combined  Bachelor  of  Arts  in
          Spanish/ Master of Arts in Teaching Spanish/ Adolescence Education
          program.
