SUNY College at Old Westbury
Faculty Senate
Resolution on Adjunct Faculty

Submitted by Christopher Hobson, ELS

November 1, 2002

WHEREAS, SUNY Old Westbury’s teaching relies in part on the efforts of dedicated
adjunct faculty, and

WHEREAS, the interests of good teaching are served by retention of experienced adjunct
faculty, and

WHEREAS, adjuncts who have served more than six consecutive semesters have
customarily been awarded full-year contracts, and

WHEREAS, this customary practice has been abrogated in the academic year 2002-3
with longtime adjuncts being offered one-semester contracts, imposing uncertainty
about future employment on faculty who have given many years of exemplary
service to SUNY Old Westbury, and
WHEREAS, this situation has also imposed uncertainty about the continuation of health
insurance and other benefits to adjunct faculty, and
WHEREAS, adjunct faculty in some departments have already been dismissed for
budgetary reasons,

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,
That the Old Westbury Faculty Senate strongly urges the Academic Vice-President’s
office to award full-year contracts to adjunct faculty with more than six semesters’
continuous service, and

That the Old Westbury Faculty Senate strongly urges the Academic Vice-President’s
office to make no further dismissals of adjunct faculty for budgetary reasons, and
That the Old Westbury Faculty Senate strongly urges United University Professions to
pursue the issue of job security for adjunct faculty at the local and state levels.
