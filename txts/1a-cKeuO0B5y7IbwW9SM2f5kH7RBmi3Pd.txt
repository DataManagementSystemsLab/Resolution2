Strategic Planning, Assessment, Analysis, and Review (SPAAR) Committee
Annual Report 2019-2020
Submitted July 6, 2020

History/Context
The College’s Strategic Planning, Assessment, Analysis, and Review (SPAAR) Committee was
created in the 2018-2019 academic year as an outgrowth of the College’s implementation of its
2018-2023 Strategic Plan. The charge and composition of the SPAAR Committee was
developed in fall 2018 by the SPAAR Committee Task Force, a group of faculty and
administrators who worked collaboratively to develop a framework for the Committee and its
work. The charge of the Committee can be found at https://www.oldwestbury.edu/spaarcommittee. The SPAAR Committee began meeting on a regular basis during 2019-2020.
Included in the charge to the SPAAR Committee is the requirement that a written progress
report be sent by June 15 each year to the campus’ bodies of governance. Although delayed by
the COVID-19 pandemic, this report is being presented as the fulfillment of that requirement.

2019-2020 Activities
The Committee’s main task was to decide how it would operationalize its charge to review the
status of the implementation of the 2018-2023 Strategic Plan. The decision was made to
develop and submit a Rubric to Division heads to gather the needed information.
During Fall 2019, a Rubric was developed in which information that the SPAAR Committee felt
was relevant could be captured, such as status of strategy implementation, individuals assigned
responsibility for specific strategies, revised target dates, benchmarks/measurements to be
used, and comments with regard to strategies and their continued relevance. The efforts of
Committee member Tom Del Giudice were instrumental in creating the rubric instruments.
Then, in December 2019, each Division head was asked to complete the Rubric, specifically
identifying strategies that they believe are no longer applicable or adding new strategies that
they believe should be implemented. The members of the Committee had previously been
divided into the subcommittees listed above, whose task it would be to evaluate the Rubrics
submitted by the Division heads.
Submission of the completed Rubrics was expected early in Spring 2020. Unfortunately, this
coincided with the arrival of the pandemic. Most Division heads were able to submit their
rubrics, even if on a delayed basis. However, due to the responsibilities of continuing
operations during the pandemic the head of Academic Affairs was unable to submit his rubric
before the end of this year’s Committee work - but has committed to doing so prior to the start
of the Fall 2020 semester.
Each subcommittee prepared a brief report of their review of the Division rubrics that were
relevant to their assigned areas of operations. All the complete subcommittee reports are

5

attached as appendices. The actual Division Rubrics submitted are accessible via the links
provided in Appendix 1.
Following are the key findings of each subcommittee:

Academic Affairs / Enrollment Services
Academic Affairs Report
The Academic Affairs Rubric was not submitted; therefore, it could not be evaluated by the
assigned subcommittee. The evaluation of the Rubric will be done in 2020-2021.
Enrollment Services Report
•

•
•

•

•

•

Contraction of high school graduate pool is a major challenge to meeting enrollment
targets.
Pandemic conditions have disrupted enrollment and recruitment strategy and practices.
Expansion and renovation of teaching and research facilities would improve retention
and allow Enrollment Services to promote our updated facilities in marketing campaign.
Increasing new student enrollment with targeted recruitment and new transfer
recruitment strategy:
o NOW (Nassau and Old Westbury): A new initiative beginning in the fall of 2019.
OW Transfer Services Group coordinating with Nassau Community College to
track students for recruitment.
o International Student Recruitment: Disrupted due to pandemic. Estimated drop
in enrollment from 20-30 to 5-10.
Recruit strategically to improve First Year Yield through Completion Rates:
o Implementation of a territory recruitment model in the fall of 2019 helps meet
targets:
assigning counselors to specific schools fostering relationships with high
school counselors;
tracking enrollment data by high school to set school specific goals;
school specific tours, visits, onsite admissions
Integration of predictive admission analytics tools improving yield rates:
o New software improves workflow and document management, tracks
engagement and identifies prospects by specific criteria increasing admission
yield rates.
Strategy 3: Expand regional recruiting to identify areas with potential dorm students to
meet target for residence hall capacity:
o New Admissions Assistant and Graduate Admissions Advisors added.

Institutional Advancement/Public & Media Relations/Human Resources
Institutional Advancement (IA) Report
•

Goal 1: Foster Student Success
o Initiatives Started – hampered by lack of staff: regional alumni events started,
Alumni Achievers brochure published, new software to identify alumni and
promote scholarships, increased number of alumni on OW Foundation (5), reengage long-separated alumni campaign started.
o Initiatives Not Started – engaging local businesses and organizations for
partnership opportunities.
o Recommendations - The Institutional Advancement Office needs to continue to
try and engage alumni as well as current students before they graduate. They
need to create a culture of giving and especially with recent graduates. Alumni
giving should be the base of all fundraising activities.

•

Goal 2: Promote Academic Excellence
Initiatives Started – OW Magazine & Alumni Achievers brochure created with
OPMR, IA-Foundation external relationships outreach, IA/OPMR alumni
social media campaign, promoting alumni to college constituents,
development of assessment tools, campus engagement events, Hicksville
Public Library cross promotion, Foundation health industry initiative for
placements and donors.
o Initiatives Not Started – IA/OPMR marketing campaign of OW achievements
to business and local media.
o Recommendation - Institutional Advancement needs to work with Public &
Media Relations to promote Student, Faculty and Alumni successes in media
campaigns. A campaign that highlights Student, Faculty and Alumni success
will greatly benefit the college in the recruitment of new students and
fundraising. It also helps to increase the status of the college within the
community.
Goal 3: Cultivate Social Justice & Environmental Responsibility
o Recommendation - Even though IA was not listed as a responsibility unit it makes
sense that they be involved in helping to raise funds to help fund the “Center for
Social Justice, Sustainability, and Community Engagement”.
Goal 4: Strengthen Institutional Effectiveness
o Initiatives Started – key stake holders to develop a comprehensive fundraising
policy and campaign, encourage Foundation to recruit two new people in
support of mission.
o

Initiatives Not Started – IA/HR assessment of staffing baselines and best
practices.
Recommendations - A revised comprehensive fundraising plan is essential to the
success of the institution, especially now due to state budget cuts and a loss of
revenue to the College in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is
extremely difficult to implement a fundraising plan with the current staffing
levels in Institutional Advancement. The assessment of staffing levels with HR is
vital to the fundraising efforts of the institution and it is imperative that review
still happens even though priorities have changed due to COVID-19.

Public & Media Relations (OPMR) Report
•

Goal 1: Foster Student Success
o Initiatives Started - most initiatives are ongoing: yearly retreat created, new
programs and faculty expertise promoted for engagement, web version of
faculty achievements published, targeted e-newsletters started.
o Initiatives Not Started – Internal e-newsletter for schools & departments
requiring departmental collaboration, monthly training sessions initiative
requires clarification of role of OPMR.
o Recommendation - OPMR depends on other departments to collaborate with
them on many initiatives. If this does not happen it effects how they function. It
is important that other constituents of the college do their part in assisting the
OPMR with related initiatives.

•

Goal 2: Promote Academic Excellence
o Initiatives Started – Moving website to new CMS for update and redesign,
created stakeholder focus groups for assessment of content and creator & user
experience.
o Initiatives Not Started – Advertising of campus events off campus to promote
community engagement.
o Recommendation – We should find a way to continue with the website upgrade.
It is the first impression many people will get of Old Westbury. It is imperative
that we keep our website up to date and use the latest technology available.

•

Goal 3: Cultivate Social Justice & Environmental Responsibility
o Initiatives Started – Ensure ADA accessibility for all online resources, publicize
green initiatives.
o Initiatives Not Started – Recruit faculty and staff whose diversity reflects the
student body, although the first class of faculty recruited under SUNY’s PRODiG
program will start in Fall 2020.
8

o
•

•

Recommendation - OPMR should be removed as a unit of responsibility for item
number 228.

Goal 4: Strengthen Institutional Effectiveness
o Initiatives Started – Improve admissions communications via CRM and other
channels, develop 3-4 year “Own Your Future” marketing campaign, increase
video & graphic content of current website.
o Initiatives Not Started – Develop annual data review of new student inquiries to
identify and clarify lead generation opportunities (delayed pending
implementation of SLATE platform which will automate data collection.)
Subcommittee Recommendations – A full-time admissions communications role would
greatly improve our communications. At least for the next academic year, we need to
change and improve our communications as traditional admissions recruiting may not
be possible due to the pandemic. However, because of budget constraints hiring
additional staff may not be possible. The OPMR should try to work with Admissions to
do their best to accomplish this goal.

Human Resources (HR) Report
Human Resources plays a role in most of the initiatives in the Strategic Plan. There are some
initiatives recommended that HR is already doing. The Strategic Plan needs to be updated to
reflect Human Resources’ ongoing initiatives. Human Resources practices and activities
relating to the Strategic Plan may require clarification.
• Goal 1: Foster Student Success
Initiatives: Research competitive salaries for staff and address inequities.
Human Resources was not a unit of responsibility for this initiative, but they
have the research available for departments to review upon college approval.
The units of responsibility need to develop a plan for this initiative and submit
for approval.
Goal 2: Promote Academic Excellence
o Initiatives: Research competitive salaries for faculty and address inequities and
salary compression, increase faculty extra service pay, create adjunct pay ladder
with titles and compensation, Increase extra service pay for department chairs.
o Human Resources was not a unit of responsibility for many of these initiatives,
but most likely should have been. They are available to assist with all these
initiatives when it reaches the point that they should become involved. Salary
compression was addressed by SUNY and UUP in the fall 2019 through the DSI.
There was already a proposal to create an adjunct faculty pay ladder that was
rejected by the college.
Goal 3: Cultivate Social Justice & Environmental Responsibility
o
o

•

•

o

•

Initiatives: Recruit faculty and staff whose diversity reflects the student body,
assess diversity compared to other institutions, examine hiring patterns, identify
new recruiting sources for diversity, develop diversity/inclusion pre-search
training for committees including chairs and division heads, develop retention
strategies, assess faculty & staff reasons for leaving using exit interviews, assess
the effectiveness of online training modules and alternatives.

Subcommittee Recommendations
o Human Resources is listed as a co-unit of responsibility for most of these
initiatives and they do serve a secondary role for many of them, but they need to
take a lead role in some of them, i.e., assess effectiveness of online training
modules, consider alternatives.

Business/Finance
The rubric was submitted, but it was not evaluated by the assigned subcommittee due to the
disruption caused by the pandemic. The evaluation of the rubric will be done in 2020-2021.

Capital/Facilities/Security-UP
Rubric data was submitted for Capital and Facilities, but no data was requested from SecurityUP. The subcommittee report submitted only evaluates Capital/Facilities.
Capital and Facilities Report
Most strategies in the rubrics were incomplete with regard to personnel responsible,
benchmarks, and revised targets dates. This resulted from a combination of two main factors:
1) if a strategy hasn’t been undertaken by other departments, then Facilities’ and Capital
Planning’s roles are on hold and 2) if funding is not available, then Capital Planning’s and
Facilities’ involvement is curtailed due to lack of progress on the project. For those items
where Capital Planning and Facilities are the leads, progress on planning and positioning to
execute those plans has been made, e.g., the new STEM building and renovations of
instructional spaces and infrastructure. With regard to green initiatives, while the Green
Committee was recreated in December 2019, there is no evidence that practical planning on
how to implement innovative projects to integrate green sensibilities and practices into campus
and student life, such as campus-wide recycling, have occurred. The financial crisis created by
the COVID-19 pandemic probably will negatively impact the ability to implement many of the
strategies in this area. The subcommittee recommends the following:

10

1. Conduct a campus-wide survey to ascertain student and employee satisfaction with
facilities and campus cleanliness. (Combining this with existing surveys should be explored
by creating an inventory of campus surveys and rationalizing such activities.)
2. Create a committee or modify the existing Faculty Senate Student Life Committee so that it
distributes an annual student survey to assess satisfaction with student life initiatives.
(Combining this with existing surveys should be explored by creating an inventory of
campus surveys and rationalizing such activities.)
3. Capital Planning should submit periodic status reports to the SPAAR Committee.

Student Affairs
Student Affairs Report
Many strategies in the rubric were incomplete with regard to personnel responsible,
benchmarks, and revised targets dates. Most of the strategies involving Student Affairs are
collaborative projects not directly under its control, such as the stalled creation of the Student
Transitions and Success Committee. However, progress has been made on some of these
projects: The Student Success Center has been created and is operational, and collaboration
with Enrollment Services in developing recruitment strategies has improved. The Student
Union has received upgrades and additional staffing to allow for later closing times. Concern
was expressed concerning the ability to fund the called-for Center for Social Justice,
Sustainability, and Community Engagement as well as a Center of Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion, given the economic impact of the pandemic. The Career Development Office is
assisting Human Resources in developing implicit bias training for the College. Internally,
Student Affairs is developing a new staff orientation and instituting “stay interviews” to
understand why employees don’t leave.
The subcommittee recommends the following:
• Create greater collaboration between Student Affairs and Enrollment Services with
regard to student recruitment so that Enrollment Services is current on out-of-class
student experiences.
• Create the Student Transitions and Success Committee or modify the existing Faculty
Senate Student Life Committee so that it distributes an annual student “needs” analysis
survey to identify issues and help formulate a plan of action, as called for in the
Strategic Plan. (Combining this with existing surveys should be explored by creating an
inventory of campus surveys and rationalizing such activities.)
• Benchmarks should be identified or developed so as to be able to assess the
effectiveness of initiatives undertaken.

11

Other Issues Addressed by the Committee
1. Effect of Pandemic – The Committee’s original plan for this year had been for its
subcommittees to evaluate Strategic Plan Rubrics submitted from all Divisions. Then, using
those subcommittee evaluation reports, it planned to make recommendations to the
President with regard to the implementation of the Strategic Plan, including possible
amendments to the Plan. However, the onset of the pandemic in March completely
disrupted that scenario. Given the disruptions caused in the Spring, the Committee focused
as best it could on getting the Division Rubrics submitted. In the completion of the Rubrics,
and in the preparation of the subcommittee evaluation reports, it became obvious that
action on many of the items in the Strategic plan had come to a standstill or was not
practicable in the pandemic situation. The Committee will address the effect of the
pandemic on the Strategic Plan, including its continued relevance, in more detail next year.
2. Committee Participation – Some members were unable to participate because the
pandemic crisis took precedence, pushing this Committee’s work to the side. Important
Rubrics were not completed, subcommittees were understaffed, and one key member of
the Committee was on medical leave due to the coronavirus. Although there were some
Committee members who attended all or most Committee meetings, despite the pandemic,
there were also members - administration, faculty, and students - who attended few
meetings. While some of this may have been due to the pandemic, this problem also
existed to a certain extent before its occurrence.
a. Administration - Some Division heads were active participants, and some did not
attend meetings regularly. The Administration should assess the importance of
administrators participating in the formal assessment of the Strategic Plan in the
coming year. Specifically, without the active participation of certain Division
heads on this committee charged with exploring the impact of the budget on the
implementation of the Strategic Plan, the effectiveness of the Committee will be
problematic. With regard to administrator attendance, the Committee revisited
the issue of allowing administrators to name designees when they can’t attend
themselves. However, this idea was rejected (as it had been in 2018-2019), since
the Committee feels that the importance of the Committee should merit the
personal attention of Division heads. Furthermore, attendance by Division heads
conveys to the campus as a whole the importance of the Committee’s work.
b. Faculty - Several faculty members stopped participating during the spring
semester, this may have been partially due to the pandemic conditions. Three
faculty members stepped down at the end of the spring semester. Faculty
participation should improve when members are elected to serve fixed terms by

12

the full faculty, which would be possible following the expected revision of the
Faculty Bylaws affirming the status of the SPAAR committee. This revision of the
Faculty Bylaws to include the Committee was expected to occur in the fall of
2019 and is now expected in the fall of 2020 to allow for the election of new
faculty members to the SPAAR Committee in the Spring 2021 elections. See Item
3 below for further discussion of the Bylaws amendment.
c. Students - Student participation was a challenge for the three representatives.
Some students attended regularly, and some did not. Much of the Committee
discussion involved issues that may have been unfamiliar to students who are
not usually a part of college governance. The role of students on the working
subcommittees needs to be re-assessed: can students be expected to take on
the workload required for full participation in subcommittee work? One
proposal to alleviate the extra workload burden this student inability causes for
the other members of the subcommittees, discussed in Item 4 below, is to allow
the addition of additional subcommittee members who are not members of the
full Committee.
3. Faculty Bylaws Amendment – The 2018-2023 Strategic Plan called for the Faculty Bylaws
to be amended to reflect the creation of the SPAAR Committee. Such amendment was not
made during this year, necessitating the appointment of replacement faculty members for
2020-2021 through faculty governance appointment rather than full faculty election as
intended. The Committee will monitor the status of this issue during 2020-2021, as
discussed below. Faculty governance should consider if faculty participation on this
Committee remains a priority and take steps to affirm this by completing the bylaws
revision in a timely fashion.
4. Subcommittee Membership - Due to the size of the Committee and the number of
subcommittees, the size of each subcommittee is necessarily small – 3 or 4 members each,
including students. Furthermore, if one or two members are not active, it becomes even
more difficult for the remaining members of the subcommittee to carry out their work. For
this year, the Committee decided to allow some Committee members to serve on more
than one subcommittee to partially alleviate this situation. However, as a longer-term
solution, the Committee discussed the possibly of having people who were not members of
the Committee serve as members of subcommittees. This issue should be resolved next
year by the Committee.

13

2020-2021 Expected Committee Activities
The Committee’s plans for next year as envisioned by the incoming Co-Chairs include the
following:
• Subcommittees will complete their analyses of 2019-2020 Division rubrics and present
recommendations to the SPAAR Committee related to progress against the Strategic
Plan and areas for recommended action/investment/exploration.
• Create a plan to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the College’s strategic direction and
investment, including the relevance of updating the Division rubrics for 2020-2021.
• Determine whether non-committee members can/will serve on SPAAR Committee
subcommittees or other functional units of the Committee.
• Monitor progress of the Faculty Senate in relation to amending the Faculty Bylaws
concerning the election of faculty members to the SPAAR Committee.
Potential deliverables to be produced by the SPAAR Committee and its subcommittees in the
coming year will include:

Appendix 2: Capital Facilities Subcommittee Report

Capital and Facilities Evaluation submitted to SPAAR Committee June 4, 2020
Thomas DelGiudice, Stephanie Schneider, Laura Gallagher

General Comments
Subcommittee reviewed Capital and Facilities rubric with admittedly some ambivalence with
respect to the very changed circumstances the College and community finds itself. Given the
pandemic and radical changes in educational delivery as well as the new budget circumstances
the assessment has taken on rather other worldly character.
The facilities rubric was filled out in the Excel format however most of the strategies, actions
were incomplete with respect to the responsible personnel, benchmarks and revised target
dates. For this reason, the rankings were 2s and 3s. Some of this can be chalked up to the
support role facilities plays in a new initiative. If a new initiative is not undertaken by the
department of origin, then the role of facilities is often on hold. In many cases the initiatives are
on hold due to funding requirements. This latter issue becomes even more problematic in the
current fiscal environment.
In those areas where Capital Planning and Facilities do need to take the lead as with the plans
for a STEM building or renovations of instructional spaces and infrastructure the division has
made progress in planning and positioning the campus to execute on those plans.
In the area of green initiatives modest progress has occurred. Most of what might be
considered green strategies relate to energy savings which also fall under saving initiatives. We
think the initiation of a Green Committee (December 2019) a priority should serious discussion
and implementation of green strategies effecting campus life, e.g. campus wide recycling. Such
initiatives integrated into campus life will be an example for our students as well as fulfillment
of a part of the College’s mission. While it does require resources there is no evidence of
discussion on what would be required or how to achieve it.
Additionally, we would like to see implementation of a campus survey that assesses student
and staff satisfaction with facilities and campus cleanliness.

Subcommittee Comments:
The Student Success Center renovation is a positive as is the transportation app for buses.
Follow-up will require the impact on student life and their satisfaction with the changes. Again,
the need for feedback speaks to a formal committee that implements an annual survey
assessing student life initiatives. Reports to SPAARC as to the status of Capital Plans should be
considered going forward.

Appendix 3: Enrollment Services Subcommittee Report
Enrollment Services Evaluation submitted to SPAAR Committee, June 10. 2020
B. Runi Mukherji, Academic Affairs/Enrollment Services Subcommittee

General Comments:
The Enrollment Services Unit was the only Rubric submitted which was related to the purview
of charge of the Academic Affairs/Enrollment Services Subcommittee.
I discussed Enrollment Services Rubric data with Frank Pizzardi, Acting Vice President of
Enrollment Services and Director of Admissions, to clarify some of the comments that were
supplied in the Rubric.
There were a number of instances where Enrollment Services was listed as one of the Units
responsible for the Strategies/Initiatives, but it was unclear what data or evidence Enrollment
Services could provide in that context. For example, Enrollment Services was named as a Unit
to be involved in Goal 1 Objective 1A: Improve Student retention. The specific Strategy
identified was to expand and renovate teaching and research facilities to meet current and
future growth in high-needs STEAM degree offerings and related faculty resource
requirements. It is unclear what role Enrollment Services could play at the present time. It is
possible that once the new Science facility is completed, Enrollment Services could develop
marketing materials to spotlight the facilities, labs and classrooms to attract more students into
STEAM and related areas.
A similar argument could be made in the case of renovations in other facilities on campus.
Once those renovations are done, Enrollment Services could use that information in marketing
strategy. Therefore, this report was based only on the data supplied for those elements related
Enrollment Services. In addition, given all the current constraints which have been imposed
due to the pandemic, my comments/recommendations are restricted primarily to those
Enrollment Services initiatives.

GOAL 1 FOSTER STUDENT SUCCESS
Objective 1B: Increase New Student Enrollment through Targeted Recruitment
Strategy 1: Continue efforts to improve transfer recruitment strategy, assess annually
for effectiveness
There has been a transition in the staffing and leadership in Enrollment services. Mr. Frank
Pizzardi is now Acting Vice President of Enrollment and Director of Admissions.

23

Since Fall 2019, a number of initiatives to improve transfer recruitment have been instituted.
The Transfer Services Group (Rachel Littenberg and Rebecca Rothe) have designed an initiative
working with Nassau Community College (NCC) called NOW (Nassau and Old Westbury).
Typically, when high school students from Nassau county and Queens did not meet SUNY-COW
selectivity criteria, they would have been referred to NCC. From that point, the student would
be in contact with staff at NCC only and the recruitment of that student would have to be reinitiated. However, through this initiative, SUNY OW maintains contact with the individual
students, can communicate with them directly and can re-recruit them for the 2019 -20
recruitment cycle The initiative was implemented in the Fall 2019 so there is no data available
currently to assess the outcome, however, Enrollment Services has an assessment program in
place and intends to assess it.
Ms Becky Evans continues to have primary responsibility over the international student
components of Enrollment Services. Typically, SUNY OW solicits and gets 20 – 30 new
international students. Currently is predicted to drop to 5- 10 due to COVID-related issues.
Strategically recruit to Improve First Year Yield through Completion Rates
Changes in demographics have led to a decline in size of the pool of high school graduates. This
trend has been in effect for the past several years and has impacted both the enrollment
targets but as well the First-Year yields.
Fall 2019, Enrollment Services implemented a territory recruitment model. Counselor were
assigned to specific high schools. They were responsible to set up private visits and onsite
admission days, which also fosters a relationship with the school counselors. Enrollment
Services also examined applications, acceptances, and enrollments by high school to set goals
for individual schools to help reach our overall goal. Offering information session, campus
tours, doing private visits, onsite admissions at high schools was very effective in meeting the
enrollment targets. The trends indicated that 85% who visit campus apply and 65% of those
who visit, enroll.
This has been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic not just because, with the school closures,
school visits could not continue, but with the closure of our campus, campus visits had to be
discontinued as well.
In addition, it goes without saying that the closure of the schools and the necessity for virtual
classrooms and instruction presents additional challenges for student preparation for college
and therefore the issue of First Year yield and completion rates. This, along with all the
tradition strategies of recruitment, support for student success once enrolled, and First Year
yield are going to have to be re-envisioned.

24

Develop and incorporate predictive admission analytics tools to recruit students with an eye to
improving admission yield rates and success.
Enrollment Services is in the process of implementing a new software program which they
believe will dramatically alter their operations. This new software program will give them the
ability to track engagement and identify students who meet criteria which will make them
more likely to enroll. Therefore, Enrollment Services can focus their efforts on that student
pool. The software enables all aspects of student documentation to be automated and
managed. For example, initial student inquiry, scheduling of campus visit, follow up for specific
documentation, individualized letters from programs or disciplines of interest, can all be
managed directly through Enrollment Services, in an integrated and streamlined manner.

STRATEGY 3: Recruit students that will help us continue to meet residence hall capacity.
Expand regional recruiting in areas where students have demonstrated a preference to live on
campus
Enrollment Services added an Admissions Assistant in the summer of 2019 as recruiter and a
Graduate Admissions Advisor in January 2020.
COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
I did not spend a lot of time or effort in developing recommendations based on the information
supplied by Enrollment Services. It should go without saying, that the COVID pandemic has
changed the landscape of education. In that context, every Goal and Objective relevant
Enrollment Services needs to be revisited and re-envisioned. As stated in the Enrollment
Services report, enrollment targets have been difficult to meet because of the demographic
changes. There is shrinking pool of high school graduates. The targets themselves need to be
re-examined because the students we traditionally have focused on in our recruitment are
minority students. They (and their parents) are the segment of the population economically,
medically, and socially hardest hit by the pandemic. Further, these students are the ones who
are most likely to be affected by the switch to online learning, regardless of the model adopted.
Because all models in the foreseeable future are going to be bounded by maintaining
precautions necessitated by COVID: social distancing, sanitizing protocols, and limitations in
transportation. This is in addition to the restrictions that will be placed on the recruitment
efforts themselves. Traditional methods of recruitment such college fairs and campus visits
have to be re-engineered in this context of limitations required by the pandemic. Further,
maintaining the levels of enrollment is going to be challenged, since it is unclear how retention
and yields will be affected by those same restrictions.

25

Most faculty are keenly aware that the modifications that will have to be made will limit the
face-to-face interactions in the “classroom”, even if it is within a virtual space, will
disproportionately affect students’ engagement and connection to the department and the
campus itself.
These are just some of the challenges confronting the campus as whole. Enrollment services
Enrollment will the most affect in all things in the college.

26

Appendix 4: Human Resources Subcommittee Report
Human Resources Evaluation submitted to SPAAR Committee June 10, 2020
Frank Pizzardi and Eliliana Martinez

GOAL 1 FOSTER STUDENT SUCCESS
Initiatives
•

Enhance staff compensation. Research competitive salaries for staff and address inequities.

Subcommittee Recommendations
Human Resources was not a unit of responsibility for this initiative but, they have the research
available for departments to review upon college approval. The units of responsibility need to
develop a plan for this initiative and submit for approval.

GOAL 2: PROMOTE ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE
Initiatives
•

Enhance faculty compensation and benefits.

•

Address salary compression.

•

Increase faculty extra service pay.

•

Create an adjunct faculty pay ladder with titles and compensation.

•

Increase extra service pay for Department Chairs who work over the summer.

Subcommittee Recommendations
Once again Human Resources was not a unit of responsibility for many of these initiatives but,
most likely should have been. They are available to assist with all these initiatives when it
reaches the point that they should become involved. Salary compression was address by SUNY
and UUP in the fall 2019. There was already a proposal to create an adjunct faculty pay ladder
that was rejected by the college.

GOAL 3: CULTIVATE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
Initiatives
•

Recruit faculty and staff whose diversity reflects the student body (racial, ethnic, religious,
gender/sexuality, economic, region, etc.)
27

•

Assess current diversity of faculty/staff compared to national, regional institutions

•

Examine hiring patterns, blind spots

•

Identify recruiting sources that will assist in maintaining and building the diversity of our
staff and faculty

•

Develop diversity/inclusion training for department Chairs, division heads and hiring
committees prior to convening faculty and staff searches

•

Develop strategies to retain staff and faculty; Find out why/which faculty/staff stay

•

Assess why some staff and faculty leave (i.e., “close loop”)

•

Conduct and review exit interviews for faculty/staff who leave

•

Assess effectiveness of online training modules, consider alternatives

Subcommittee Recommendations
Human Resources is listed as a co-unit of responsibility for most of these initiatives and they do
serve a secondary role for many of them but, they need to take a lead role in some of them.
i.e. Assess effectiveness of online training modules, consider alternatives.

Subcommittee Comments
Human Resources serves a secondary role in most of the initiatives in this strategic plan. There
were also some initiatives recommended that HR responded that they are already doing. There
is either a lack of knowledge on the part of the authors of the 2018 – 2023 Strategic Plan or a
lack of communication from Human Resources. If that is not the case and the thought is that
the current policies and procedures that Human Resources follows needs to be changed that
needs to be communicated to the Human Resources Department.

28

Appendix 5: Institutional Advancement Subcommittee Report
Institutional Advancement Evaluation submitted to SPAAR Committee June 10, 2020
Frank Pizzardi and Eliliana Martinez

GOAL 1 FOSTER STUDENT SUCCESS
Initiatives
•

Institutional Advancement has started numerous initiatives and was able to complete
some, but they are hampered by lack of personnel resources with only four (4) staff
members including the VP.

•

They were able to start regional alumni events to help engage the Alumni with the college.

•

They Created an Alumni Achievers brochure to hi-lite Alumni.

•

They have utilized the software to identify Alumni and their place of employment.

•

Increased funding for scholarships and utilize software to promote and accept scholarship
applications to help streamline the process.

•

Recruited Old Westbury Alumni to serve as Trustees on the Old Westbury Foundation
increasing the number of Alumni on the Old Westbury Foundation to five (5).

•

Working to engage long separated Alumni to re-engage with the college.

Initiatives Not Started
•

Working local businesses and organizations to create partnership opportunities.

Subcommittee Recommendations
The Institutional Advancement Office needs to continue to try and engage Alumni as well as
current students before they graduate. They need to create a culture of giving and especially
with recent graduates. Alumni giving should be the base of all fundraising activities.

GOAL 2: PROMOTE ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE
Initiatives
•

Collaborated with Public and Media Relations (PMR) on the creation of the OW Magazine
and the Alumni Achievers brochure.

•

Work with the College Foundation and other campus constituents to broaden and
strengthen external relationships.

29

•

Advise PMR on Advancement-related social media campaigns to further engage with alumni

•

Share noteworthy alumni accomplishments with college constituents.

•

Develop an assessment tool for relevant events and activities.

•

Create events to allow campus engagements

•

Work with the Hicksville Public Library to cross promote events and increase local outreach
and participation

•

Collaborate with Foundation Trustees to within the health industry for student placement
and potential donor contacts

Initiatives Not Started
•

Collaborate with PMR to create a marketing campaign to promote Student, Faculty and
Alumni success stories through the Long Island Business News and other media outlets.

Subcommittee Recommendations
The Institutional Advancement needs to work with Public and Media Relations to promote
Student, Faculty and Alumni successes in media campaigns. A campaign that hi-lights Student,
Faculty and Alumni success will greatly benefit the college in the recruitment of new students
and fundraising. It also helps to increase the status of the college within the community.

GOAL 3: CULTIVATE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
Initiatives
•

Institutional Advancement was not listed as a unit of responsibility for goal 3 but, they did
list an outcome for Strategy 2. They have put together a cohesive fundraising plan and they
are utilizing Raiser’s Edge NXT database software that will help them to assess donors and
prospective donors.

Subcommittee Recommendations
Even though IA was not listed as a responsibility unit it makes sense the they are involved in
helping to raise funds to help fund the “Center for Social Justice, Sustainability, and Community
Engagement”.

GOAL 4: Strengthen Institutional Effectiveness
Initiatives
•

Work with the President’s Office, Business and Finance, Academic Affairs, Capital Planning,
30

and other key stake holders to develop a comprehensive fundraising policy and campaign.
•

Enhance Division Staff

•

Encourage the College Foundation Trustees to recruit two people each year to support the
mission of the college.

Initiatives not started
•

Collaboration with HR to assess/ establish staffing baselines in accordance with national best
practices to begin in the fall 2020.

Subcommittee Recommendations
A comprehensive fundraising plan is essential to the success of the institution especially now due
to state budget cuts and a loss of revenue to the college in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, it is extremely difficult to implement a fundraising plan with the current staffing levels
in Institutional Advancement. The assessment of staffing levels with HR is vital to the fundraising
efforts of the institution and it is imperative that review still happens even though we have to
priorities have changed due to COVID-19.

Subcommittee Comments
Given limited resources in staffing Institutional Advancement has made many efforts to support
the mission and initiatives of the college. We also need to realize that many of their fundraising
events that they have during the academic year have either been postponed or cancelled due
to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Many of those events generate funds for our scholarship programs.
This leaves Institutional Advancement with the task of developing new and creative ways to
raise money for the institution. With the effect that COVID-19 is having on our institutional
budget and economy fundraising becomes more important than ever. It is imperative that the
staffing levels in Institutional Advancement increase.

31

Appendix 6: Public & Media Relations Subcommittee Report
Public and Media Relations Evaluation submitted to SPAAR Committee June 10, 2020
Frank Pizzardi and Eliliana Martinez

General Comments
The rubric was completed, and all responses were clear and concise within all initiatives.
Scores of 3 were given for all responses and one area was noted as a main priority to be
completed. Many of the initiatives for OPMR are shared with other divisions and without
collaboration from those divisions so some initiatives that are not started should not be a
reflection on the Office of Public and Media Relations. We also have to take into consideration
of the demands that have placed on the OPMR due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

GOAL 1 FOSTER STUDENT SUCCESS
Initiatives Started
•

OPMR started many of the initiatives and many of them will not be completed as they are
continuous initiatives.

•

Establishment of yearly retreat was developed

•

Engage high schools / community members by highlighting new/growth program areas and
emerging faculty expertise in forums, co-curricular events, and marketing

•

Create web version of faculty achievements publication

•

Create e-newsletter for speaker series, share with high schools, regional newspapers,
alumni

Initiatives Not Started
•

Develop and circulate E-Newsletter with Schools and Academic departments. However, a
college e-letter to campus "friends" was created in 2018 and expanded to alumni who optin in 2019. There needs to be collaboration from the Academic departments.

•

Develop monthly training sessions for students, faculty, and staff. This is a vague initiative
and not sure how it relates to the OPMR.

Subcommittee Recommendations
OPMR depends on other departments to collaborate with them on many initiatives. If this does
not happen it effects how they function. It is important that other constituents of the college
do their part in assisting the OPMR with related initiatives.

32

GOAL 2 PROMOTE ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE
Initiatives Started
•

Continue to improve College website as the face of the institution

•

Create focus groups of OW and other students, their parents, OW faculty and staff to assess
the quality, and effectiveness of the web information.

•

Divide site clearly into academic and co-curricular offerings

Initiatives Not Started
•

Via advertising, invite surrounding community to campus for academic events, conferences,
debates, lectures, art shows, performances

•

Have OW present a clear “visual” identity via photos and video on website

Subcommittee Recommendations
OPMR has gone through the RFP process to find a company to help develop a new website.
Our website is the first impression many people will get of Old Westbury and you only get one
chance to make a first impression. That is why it is imperative that we keep our website up to
date and use the latest technology available. That is why we recommend that with the current
state of our budget we find a way to continue with the upgrade.
Here is a quote from the OPMR regarding item number 201,
“Frankly, OPMR takes umbrage with this strategy. Its presence suggests we do not present a
clear visual identity, which we contend is false. We recognize there is always room for
improvement, but do not concur with this item.”

GOAL 3 CULTIVATE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
Initiatives Started
•

Assure accessibility under ADA for all online resources.

•

Publicize our successes as a green campus

Initiatives Not Started
•

Recruit faculty and staff whose diversity reflects the student body (racial, ethnic, religious,
gender/sexuality, economic, region, etc.)

Subcommittee Recommendations
We recommend that the OPMR be removed as a unit of responsibility for item number 228.

33

GOAL 4 STRENGTHEN INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS
Initiatives Started
•

Improve admissions-related communication via CRM and other means (direct mail, etc.)
o OPRM Response: Hire admissions communications officer

•

Plan and design the College’s next 3-4-year marketing campaign in support of the “Own
Your Future” brand

•

Enhance current College website with video and increased graphics

Initiatives Not Started
•

Develop annual data review related to new student inquiries (online and hard copy)
submitted to admissions-related functions to identify and clarify lead generation
opportunities
o OPRM Response: Rather than take on what would be a manual process, OPMR is
hopeful that the implementation of SLATE may aid in this gathering, processing

Subcommittee Recommendations
Admissions – related communications is a fulltime job and a person with that singular role
would be able to greatly improve our communications. Considering what the future holds due
to the COVID-19 pandemic there is even more of a need to change and improve our
communications as traditional admissions recruiting may not be possible. However, we also
must realize that due to budget constraints hiring additional staff may not be possible. The
OPMR should try to work with Admissions to do their best to accomplish this goal.

34

Appendix 7: Student Affairs Subcommittee Report
Student Affairs Evaluation submitted to SPAAR Committee May 13, 2020
Thomas DelGiudice and Jason Kaloudis

General Comments
Jason Kaloudis and Thomas DelGiudice reviewed Student Affairs rubric with admittedly some
ambivalence with respect to the very changed circumstances the College and community finds
itself. Given the pandemic and radical changes in educational delivery as well as the new
budget circumstances the assessment has taken on a rather other worldly character.
With respect to the Student Affairs one issue was the rubric was filled out in a Word format so
columns having to do with responsible personnel and revised target dates were missing. We
created additional columns to include our comments and rankings. The rankings related to
Student Affairs are predominantly 2s and 3s as cells related to responsible personnel, target
dates and benchmarks were insufficiently completed in many cases. I suspect that will ~be true
about others as well.
Important to note that many of the initiatives being evaluated are collaborative and do not
fall squarely on Student Affairs. The Objective is to pick out those strategies that could be
most impactful and relevant in our next two years of alternate reality for focus and
execution.

GOAL 1 FOSTER STUDENT SUCCESS
Initiatives Started
• Student Affairs has succeeded in getting a number of initiatives off the ground. Including
collaborating on the Student Success Center. Facilities has been renovated and some
staffing has been included as well as new software applications for advising and data
gathering.
•

Orientation services and events have gotten a high rating from constituents

• Greater collaboration has occurred with respect to including Student Affairs and
Residential Life in recruitment strategies, but need to “develop ongoing collaborative events
to ensure ES/Admissions staff are up to date on out of class student experiences.”
• Student Union social spaces have received upgrades and staff for later hours has been
added.

35

• Alumni initiatives needs\ more exploration. Residential Life has provided 10 years of
contact information.
Initiatives Not Started
• “Student Transitions and Success” committee has not been created and does not fall
entirely on Student Affairs so if that committee is to go forward it will need leadership.
•

As a consequence of the above work on lower division office for first year to sophomore
year has not started.
•

Survey of students to identify issues and help formulate a plan of action has not been
initiated.
•

Access to Clark Center and late-night spaces on hold based on funding issues.

•

Alumni initiatives needs more exploration. Residential Life has provided 10 years of
contact information.

Subcommittee Recommendations
A committee, perhaps a reconfigured Student Life Committee with all the actors would be able
tie together different issues that arise for student life and student transitions. Such a
committee/survey should include areas such as Food Services, SGA, Security, Residential Life,
Advising, Academic Support, Technology etc.
Such a committee would conduct an annual survey so as to assess successes and weaknesses.
GOAL 2: PROMOTE ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE
Create Center for Social Justice, Sustainability, and Community Engagement this initiative
comes under Academic Affairs but there is a concern that such an initiative would compete for
funds with Career Development Office (CDO).
SA: Student Affairs recommendation “create a campus wide Center of Diversity, Equity
and Inclusion and staff it with full time CDO and support team (Admin. Asst.,
Program/outreach coordinators, etc.). The Center would be responsible for supporting
academic and co-curricular programs and initiatives.”
GOAL 3: CULTIVATE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
Objective 3A: Sustain and Increase the Diversity of Faculty and Staff
Initiatives Started
• Strategy 2: Develop diversity/inclusion training for department Chairs, division heads
and hiring committees prior to convening faculty and staff searches
o

SA: Career Development Office developing implicit bias training for HR
36

•

Strategy 3: Enrich orientation and training for new staff and faculty
o

•

Explore and identify opportunities for advanced professional/educational attainment
and development (i.e. – professional conferences, for-credit courses, etc.).
o

•

SA: has begun working on developing a new staff orientation for its employees

SA: Professional Development funds have been dedicated for SA staff as of
Summer 2018. Staff have accessed funds for a number of professional
development opportunities.

Strategy 4: Develop strategies to retain staff and faculty
o

SA: is going to be instituting “Stay Interviews” for its employees. Stay interviews
are conducted to help supervisors understand why employees stay and what
might cause them to leave.

Objective 3B: Build on Student Diversity to Foster Campus-wide Community of
Inclusion & Respect
•

Strategy 1: Foster inclusive campus, sense of community, and shared space
o

SA: This works occurs in a myriad of offices within SA and all are welcome to
attend. Examples include affinity group events (BHM, Latinx, Women’s History,
LGBTQIA+, etc.)
Common Hour change will be discussed with acting Provost for his review.

•

Coordinate and support student-focused diversity initiatives
o

•

SA: Diversity and Inclusion sessions have been part of Orientation since its
inception in 2010.

Create annual student diversity program plan
o

SA: Will be responsibility of the incoming Asst. Dir in CSLI during Summer 2020

Subcommittee Comments
Given limited resources Student Affairs has made a good faith effort to develop and
incorporate diversity programing and training both in orientation, student events and for staff.
Our recommendation is to find benchmarks that we can show progress in these initiatives. The
survey for orientation activities represents such an effort.

37
