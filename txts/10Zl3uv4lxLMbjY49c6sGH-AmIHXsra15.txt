President’s Report

Committee Updates 

Presidential Committees

Many co-chairs have begun to meet – slow start and some confusion with the work of the Planning and Budget Committee 

Clearing up work of the PBC – apologize for slow start 

First meetings will happen soon 

Chief of staff will give each committee two expectations

Post minutes online – so activities are transparent internally to campus

Work collaboratively with similar committees 

With the present committees and existing committees, these should be able to work together to reduce redundancy of members and tasks 

Clean up the charges of respective charges – as work is done and the committee realizes it doesn’t need to work on certain topics, advise and consult with President to recommend changes to charges 

These are important to elevate college, so they need to be effective and transparent – strong instrument for the college

Planning and Budget Committee

SPAAR – strategic

Will begin work associated with new strategic planning for next year 

Inclusion of ideas and participation 

PBC – two primary responsibilities

Performance planning – go through the 40+ proposals

CFO come up with a design with PBC to make their work available to all

This is coming up soon

Full time faculty taskforce recommendations (conducted last academic years)

Next Cabinet meeting (upcoming Tuesday) is focused on these recommendations – how can we enact what is represented there

Go back to taskforce for clarity if necessary to 

How are we building up our fulltime faculty – right balance 

How are we populating courses and departments 

Thanked taskforce for innovative ideas 

Clark center update (Nassau County’s only mass vaccination point)

Dramatic increase in vaccination ~ 900 people a day getting vaccines and boosters 

Our job as a state entity to fight covid – but this affects students’ recreation and our sports offerings 

Discussing Department of Health – continued use for site in Spring 2022 but give students greater use of facilities including use of athletic contests in gym and access to the pool  

Preparations for the spring

Some had problems with tech (getting laptop or tech devices) – we don’t want that to happen again in spring 2022

Student concerns in Academic Village – trying to address some issues between fall 2021 and spring 2022

Gym? Kitchen facilities? 

ASIDE: Budget questions:

Funding from residents can only be spent on residential framework – this money comes from residents and additional funds (Wellness funds and HEERF III)

Vaccination framework

Everyone must be vaccinated and checking exemptions for spring

Adhering to SUNY guidelines and Best Practices (CDC, Public Health)

Thanked COVID taskforce for the work – we remain some of the lowest incidents of COVID in SUNY system 

Concerns help inform Covid-19 reaction on campus

VPIA Search

Wrapped up a week ago, President looking at responses and survey results from those present, search committee, cabinet,

Shortly (perhaps next Friday) will share the VP candidate once negotiations are complete 

Chancellor’s resignation

He was very supportive of our efforts and believed in our mission and commitment to students, access to students, made it clear with President’s hire that he felt that way 

Very supportive of Natural Science building renovation – getting clarification of phases and gave a sense he was going back to Construction Fund, especially location of Vivarium 

He wanted to resolve concern

President hopes Chancellor will address and will push for a resolution on matter before he leaves

President assures he will continue to advocate for this 

Holiday activities

Postponed activities – because of Delta and Omnicron 

Saddened that we are possibly cancelling plans for institution since this would be good to share burdens with each other 

Understands all the hard work everyone is doing right now 

Symbolic – everyone gets a pie, everyone matters 

Questions

Andrew Mattson asked about the Media Innovation center delays and the delay of Radio Center computer installation

Response: renovation of site where computers are installed is delayed. Asks last week for update, and believed it was a question of gap in planning – not due to supply chains. Will have it clarified by next week. MIC funds are time sensitive, and this bumps up the project’s needed completion date

Peter Ikeler appreciated the internal negotiations for Science Building with the Chancellor but wants to point out that this was a moral outrage with bullying and disparaging remarks and we need to support whistle-blowers 

Chris Hartmann: regarding NSB renovations, have we reached out to local officials about NYS budget planning occurring right now

This is less cut and paste – more about ensuring the implementation goes forward 

Can faculty reach out for state advocacy? President will discuss with Mike Kinane 

Laurie Morris: responding about budget – we need to advocate as private citizens but USF president advocates, and the Chancellor was also going to advocate more funds. We need to let officials know how we help community – like covid vaccinations. 

Martha Livingston: UUP always does this state-wide, OW campus less active, and we can activate our outreach efforts – anyone who wants to best do that, contact her
