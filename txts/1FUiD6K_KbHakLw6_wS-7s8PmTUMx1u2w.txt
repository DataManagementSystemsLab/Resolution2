Resolution Regarding the Old Westbury College Website
Whereas, the current College website is outdated, inefficient, unreliable and presents an
unfavorable image of the College to everyone who seeks information about us on the
Internet, and
Whereas, every other SUNY college has a better, clearer, more easily updatable website,
and
Whereas, our own students cannot adequately or efficiently access information about
majors, programs, advising, or contact information, and
Whereas, we can logically conclude that the continued failure to revise/repair/replace
the College website is causing continuous damage to the College’s reputation, and
Whereas, there has been an initiative to replace our website underway for many
months, which has been making steady but slow progress,
Be it resolved that:
Additional resources be allocated to bring the new website “live” within a month, and
be it further resolved that:
The Office of Public and Media Relations report to each subsequent meeting of the
Faculty Senate on the receipt of such resources, and progress towards achievement of a
new, modern, functional website for the College, until that goal has been achieved.
