Dr. Calvin O. Butts, III,
President
SUNY College at Old Westbury
Dear Dr. Butts:
Thank you for your memorandum of March 10, 2005, requesting input on the forum for
your presentation of a report in response to the resolution passed by the Faculty Senate on
Dec. 17, 2004. At this point, I interpret the Faculty Bylaws as saying that, as chair of the

faculty, you are authorized to call a special meeting of the faculty (Article IV B.2 on pp. 6-7).

As with Senate meetings, meeting would be public, so anyone from on or off would be
welcome to attend as a visitor.

In Article IV C.1, the Bylaws stipulate that an announcement of the meeting, with an agenda
would have to be received by the faculty at least a week in advance of the meeting. It is

understood that the announcement would have to explicitly designate the meeting as a

special meeting of the faculty. Also understood, from the Bylaws’ interrelationship to
Robert’s Rules, the meeting would have to be conducted in accordance with the Rules of
otder. For example, it would be chaited by yourself or your designee; minutes would be

taken and subsequently made available; and the voting members of the assembly (faculty)
would duly deliberate on how and whether to accept the report.

Such a meeting could take place on either of the dates you mention, March 29 or April 7.

Practically, for the notice and agenda to reach the faculty in time, it would have to get to the

copy shop by March 15 (before the break) for a March 29th meeting or by March 29 for the

Aptil 7" meeting.

As for assuring faculty presence, neither of the times presented is a Common Hour, meaning
that some faculty would be teaching classes. In any case, at this point I am not in a position
to judge whether this arrangement would constitute a satisfactory response to the Senate
resolution. It would be up to the Senate to deliberate that question.
Sincerely,

Caroline Sawyer
Faculty Senate Chair
