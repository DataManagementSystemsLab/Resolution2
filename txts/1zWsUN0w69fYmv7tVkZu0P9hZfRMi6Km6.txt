      “jointly registered program”) to be offered jointly  by  two  or  more
      institutions.  Complete Part B, below.   NOTE:  Such programs  involve
      a formal agreement between two or more institutions to  offer  courses
      leading to an award.

i) List all the courses required for each  existing  program,  and  indicate
   which ones will be counted toward both awards. See attachment 1
j) How long will it take for full-time students  to  complete  the  proposed
   program? 5 years
k) What are the admissions requirements for the new  program,  and  how  are
   they related to student success?
      Candidates must apply for the program by the end of Junior year. They
      must have 12 credits of residency. All candidates must show a GPA of
      3.25 overall and 3.25 in the courses required for the History / Social
      Studies B.A. degree.  An interview is required.
      Transfer students ‘GPA must meet Old Westbury’s GPA requirements and
      transfer courses must be calculated along with Old Westbury grades for
      admission to this program.


      Candidates must submit an application that includes
       • An essay
       • GRE scores
       • Two letters of reference from faculty
       • All college transcripts


       Highly qualified candidates will complete the program in five years
      by accelerating undergraduate coursework, and moving on to graduate
      study in the fourth year.   Candidates must maintain a GPA of 3.25
      (overall and in the major) in each semester of study.  Additionally,
      no grades of D are permitted for any required courses, and candidates
      must meet requirements of the History / Social Studies major. Those
      whose GPA falls below 3.25 will be placed on probation and will have
      one semester to bring up their grades. Candidates who fail to complete
      the five-year program will be administratively transferred into the
      History / Social Studies major, and will graduate with the B.A.
      degree.




l) Complete a SUNY Sample Program Schedule to  show  how  students  will  be
   able to  schedule  all  required  courses  to  complete  the  multi-award
   program.

|For programs leading to initial certification, list all pedagogical courses in the|
|proposed program in the Pedagogical Core Courses table below.   The Pedagogical   |
|Core Courses Table is designed for a program leading to a single certificate or   |
|multiple certificates. See example on Pedagogical Core Courses Table for an       |
|inclusive childhood education program leading to Childhood Education 1-6 (Cert    |
|Code: 02) and Teaching Students with Disabilities 1-6 (Cert Code: 06).            |
|                                                                                  |
|Step 1:                                                                           |
|In the first four columns, identify each pedagogical course by course number,     |
|title, number of credits, required (R) or elective (E), and the                   |
|instructor(s)/status (full-time or part-time). See example on Pedagogical Core    |
|Courses Table.                                                                    |
|                                                                                  |
|Step 2:                                                                           |
|Use the Certification Area Codes listed immediately below to identify the         |
|certificate area(s) the program leads to and insert the certificate area number   |
|code(s) in the Cert Code column(s). For example, if a program prepares candidates |
|for certification in Childhood Education 1-6 and Teaching Students with           |
|Disabilities Childhood 1-6, mark 02 and 06 in the Cert Code columns. See example  |
|on Pedagogical Core Courses Table.                                                |
