Resolution to Revise Governance Compensation Policy

(Presented by Faculty Senate Executive Committee)

Whereas, the Faculty Senate Chair serves as the principal faculty governance leader of the campus, and as such has responsibilities and obligations which may exceed, and are at least comparable to those of Department Chairs; and, 

Whereas, there are an existing precedents within SUNY of more flexible compensation policies; and, 

Whereas, the current Governance Compensation Policy as prescribed in the Bylaws has been included in discussions before the Senate and within the Executive Committee this past year concerning potential Bylaws amendments; and, 

Whereas, the current Governance Compensation Policy of the campus is not on par with the compensation afforded Department Chairs; therefore be it 

Resolved, That the Faculty Senate agrees to amend the Governance Compensation language (Article V § F) to read “The Chair of the Senate shall receive release time from teaching and financial compensation (e.g., a stipend, salary on base) equal to release time and the highest rate of compensation received by an Academic Department Chair at the College during his/her term in office”; and, 

Resolved, That the Administration (the Provost and the President) consent to such change in the Governance Compensation Policy, retroactive to August 15, 2014, or the date at which the Senate Chair’s 2014-15 term begins, subject to ratification by the Senate.
