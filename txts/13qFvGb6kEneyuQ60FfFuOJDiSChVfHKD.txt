Resolution for Proposal for
A Minor in Pre-Health Professions
WHEREAS, the Department of Biology proposed a Minor in Pre-Health Professions, and
WHEREAS, the curriculum of the proposed minor includes most common pre-requisites for
professional programs in a health-related field and thus would help students prepare for careers
in a growing healthcare field,
WHEREAS, the proposed minor consists of two core courses in Biology and four elective
courses in natural or social science fields, including Mathematics, Public Health,
Chemistry/Physics, Psychology, Sociology, and Biology
WHEREAS, all departments that would contribute a course/courses expressed their support for
the proposed minor,
WHEREAS, the proposed minor is built on existing courses and thus requires no additional
resources,

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Faculty Senate approve the proposed Minor in
Pre-Health Professions.

Proposal for Pre Health Professions Minor

Purpose What knowledge and/or skills is the minor designed to confer? How will these
benefit students?
This minor can help students complete many, but not necessarily all, of the most common prebenefit any student
interested in a career in the Health Professions, regardless of their academic major.

Demand Which students are likely to take this minor? What might it allow them to do
upon graduation?
Students in any academic major who want to pursue a career in the Health Professions can
benefit from the Pre Health Professions Minor. It will document their interest in a career in the
Health Professions and allow them to take many of the pre requisite courses for the graduate
programs they plan to apply to. Upon graduation they hopefully will be more prepared to apply to
these graduate programs and after completion of those programs they may begin their careers in
the health professions.

Curriculum Which existing courses will be used to support the new minor? What new
courses will be developed?
All courses used to support this minor are currently existing courses and are listed by department
in the attached proposal. No new courses will need to be developed at this time.

Instruction Who will teach the courses in the new minor (i.e., which faculty members,
from which departments)?
Since the courses are currently existing courses, it is anticipated that the faculty of the respective
departments will teach the courses.

Resources What existing curricular resources (facilities, equipment) will be devoted to
the new minor? What additional curricular resources might be needed before the
program can be offered?

Since all courses are currently existing courses it is not anticipated that any new facilities or
equipment will need to be devoted to this minor, nor will any other additional curricular
resources be needed before the program can be offered.

Administration Which department(s) and/or faculty member(s) will have responsibility
for advising students in the new minor?
This minor is being proposed by the Biological Sciences Department and as such the faculty of
the Biological Science Department and the members of the Health Professions Advisory
Committee will advise students in this minor.

Pre Health Professions Minor
Many students graduating from SUNY Old Westbury aspire to have careers in the Health
Professions. They may want to become physicians, dentists, podiatrists, optometrists,
veterinarians, chiropractors, physician assistants, physical therapists, occupational
therapists, respiratory therapists, nurses or any of the many other members of the modern
health care team. The career path to achieve those goals generally involves post
graduate education, clinical training and graduation from an appropriate professional
graduate program. Entrance into these programs is now more competitive than ever.
There are a variety of courses that are pre-requisites for acceptance to these programs
which can differ from field to field and from program to program. Students who want to
apply to programs leading to these careers can complete any major as long as they
successfully complete the appropriate pre-requisite courses for the programs they are
interested in. This minor can help students complete many, but not necessarily all, of the
most common pre-requisites for most of today’s Health Professions Programs and can
benefit any student interested in a career in the Health Professions, regardless of their
academic major. Students working towards this minor are strongly encouraged to speak
with a Health Professions Advisor to determine which of the offered elective courses will
be most beneficial both for the Pre Health Professions Minor and when applying to
graduate programs for their chosen career.
Requirements:
All students are required to complete a minimum of 6 courses, totaling 24 or more credits.
A minimum of 16 credits must be taken outside of the courses required for the student’s
academic major. Up to 2 courses may be transferred from another institution for purposes
of completing the Minor. Completion of the Pre Health Professions minor requires a
minimum of a 2.0 grade point average in courses applied to the minor, and only grades
of “C” or higher may be applied to the minor.

A. Required Core Courses;
