FCCC

Resolution

Dear colleagues:
Below is a copy of a letter | sent to Chancellor King this morning.
Kimberley
===== Original Message From reiserk <reiserk@sunynassau.edu> =====
Dear Chancellor King,
At the FCCC Fall Plenary meeting on October 4,2003, the FCCC adopted the
attached resolution.
Please be assured that it was only after serious and careful debate about
university-wide assessment and the merits of the MOU that the resolution was
adopted. In fact, the FCCC suspended the agenda of the meeting and spent 2
long days in heated academic discourse and debate. Four very different
resolutions were discussed for consideration and at the end of the day, the
faculty decided that it was paramount to express their consistent and
determined opposition to university-wide assessment and to the process by
which the Board of Trustees adopted the June 17th resolution on
university-wide assessment.

It is the ardent hope of the FCCC that our very good discussion that began
with you on Thursday night will continue. The faculty were pleased by your
candor and determination in working to enhance "systemness" and support the
common

and unique challenges that face the community colleges.

Please also be

assured that each and every delegate is committed to working with System
Administration to meet the goals of the Strategic Plan and move the State
University of New York to the front line of American higher education.
With best regards,

Kimberley Reiser
