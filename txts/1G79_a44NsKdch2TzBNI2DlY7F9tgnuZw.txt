IOTA360 Evaluations is the best value available today.
Don’t be fooled by claims of “Low Cost of Ownership”. If
you are running your whole evaluations process
yourselves, it’s costing you hundreds of hours and
thousands of dollars per year needlessly. Let IOTA take
that burden from you for about the same annual cost
that all the self service providers charge. And if you’re
one of the handful of schools that really prefers to run
the whole process, we do have self-service options
available too which can save you even more money.
