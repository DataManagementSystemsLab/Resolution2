The New York Times calls Amir Vahab the "ambassador for a silenced music." Honored as a
peacemaker and virtuoso, Amir Vahab is one of New York’s most celebrated and distinguished
composer/vocalist of Sufi and folk music. The virtuoso of Amir weaves fiery instrumentals and songs of
the historic lands of the Middle East and Central Asia. His work transcends political boundaries while
maintaining traditional sensibilities in a way few artists can manage.
Amir Vahab's music is rooted in tradition, but has been influenced by contemporary sounds. Like Amir
himself, his music symbolizes diversity-in-unity.
His performances have been recognized worldwide and have inspired many music students. Amir Vahab
is
currently teaching and lecturing private and group classes in universities, libraries, museums and cultural
centers. He also organizes music therapy and sound healing workshops. www.tanbour.org

Amir Vahab and his Ensemble will perform
"Sufi songs of Love" selected from the
poetry of the great Sufi Masters Rumi,
Hafez, Yunus and Baba Taher. The lively
folk and traditional music featuring the
ethereal sounding Ney (mystical reed
flute), Tar, (Instrument of Lovers), Oud
(the short neck lute), Tanbour (The ancient
sacred lute), Saz (seven-stringed long
neck lute), Daf (large frame drum
associated with Sufi rituals) and Tombak
(Persian goblet drum). The concert
concludes with a dynamic drumming
performance that echoes the universal
heartbeat of existence.
