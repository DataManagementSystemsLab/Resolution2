Discouraging Plagiarism through Assignment Design: Some Strategies
1) Provide an assignment sheet with detailed information about what is required. Include the specific
question students should answer, the required number of sources, the types of sources acceptable for the
paper (peer-reviewed articles? newspapers? websites?), and due dates for any preliminary assignments
and the final draft. Clearly defined instructions will help to reduce students’ anxiety and confusion.
2) Consider designing authentic assignments: Authentic assignments ask students to write for real
audiences and real purposes, tasks that can heighten investment in assignments and help students
prepare for post-college writing. For example, students might be assigned to write letters to an elected
official or a letter to the editor of a particular newspaper or an essay to be posted in an online forum.
Assignments that require writing for a specific audience or occasion but will not necessarily be read by
real-world readers can also be a valuable learning experience. For example, students might write a
speech for delivery at the United Nations.
3) Make your assignments course-specific: Specific assignments make it more difficult for students to find
“canned” prepared papers online or elsewhere. For example, you might ask students to incorporate in
their essay
a) a specific book or article read by the class
b) a discussion board post or particular class lecture
c) an original survey or interview they conduct
d) a primary source document not readily available online
e) a data set constructed by the class
4) Use a process approach: Help students avoid feeling overwhelmed by breaking large, complex
assignments into a series of more manageable steps. This approach also acts as a disincentive to
plagiarism since students may perceive it to be more difficult to “write backwards” from someone else’s
completed paper than to do the work themselves. A sample sequence of assignments leading to a final
research paper might include
A topic proposal
An annotated bibliography
A detailed outline or first draft
A final draft
Ask students to submit some or all of this preliminary work with their final draft. This approach allows
you to give them credit for revision, if you wish, and to check for any suspicious whole-scale changes
from one step to the next.
5) Assign “low-stakes” reflective writing: If students are required to reflect on their research and writing
processes, you will have the opportunity to help them trouble-shoot as their papers are in progress.
Reflective writing also helps students better retain the research and writing skills they are learning.
For example, a short time after assigning a paper, you might ask students to write a brief in-class
reflection on their research process so far answering questions like “How many sources have they
found? What are they? What difficulties have they encountered so far?” This writing could serve as
the basis for an in-class discussion or be collected to identify students who may need assistance.

6) Devote class time to discussing appropriate citation practices. Discuss with students why plagiarism is
considered a serious offense in academia and how it is detrimental to their learning and professional
development. Provide instruction on paraphrasing, quoting, and proper citation of sources.

Some Reasons Students Plagiarize
LACK OF INTEREST
Students may believe an assignment to be busywork, or that the
teacher does not read their essays carefully or with honest
interest; they are therefore unwilling to work if their effort will not
be recognized.
LACK OF INVESTMENT
Students may see some classes as more relevant to their
education than others, or may not be fully invested in the ideal of
intellectual inquiry. Students may not see the connection between
the assignment and their learning or career goals.
FEAR OF FAILURE
Students may have strong pressures on them to earn high grades,
especially those with scholarships that require maintaining a
minimum GPA. Lack of confidence leads them to rely on others.
LACK OF ABILITIES
Students may be unprepared to tackle a given assignment but too
embarrassed to seek help.
POOR TIME MANAGEMENT
Students may lack good study habits, or may not realize how long
a project will take to complete, and therefore procrastinate
ruinously. Rather than ask for an extension (or faced with a
teacher who accepts no late papers), students opt to cheat.
NO FEAR OF CONSEQUENCES
Students may simply not care about getting caught, or in an
amoral cost/benefit analysis, believe the benefits outweigh the
risks. Some simply like beating the system.
