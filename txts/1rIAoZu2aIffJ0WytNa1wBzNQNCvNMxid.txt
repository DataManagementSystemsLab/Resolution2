Sept. 2, 2004
Dear Colleagues:

As incoming Faculty Senate chair, I would like to welcome you to the néw
academic year, whether you have:been on campus for part of the summer or throughout

or are coming back after a break. I want to extend special greetings to those who are

coming to Old Westbury for the first time, and I hope to meet'you soon.

°

This year the Faculty Senate enters its 14" session, having evolved: from the
former Faculty Council in 1991: According to the Faculty Bylaws; the Senate serves as
“the deliberative body for organizing and carrying out the business
of the Faculty.” It is
the primary body of faculty governance, and I encourage everyone to get involved.
Each department should already have elected, or be about to elect, a
representative and an alternate. The representatives are voting members of the Senate
and are responsible to attend meetings. But all faculty are welcome and encouraged to
attend, joining our members and visitors from among the faculty, professional staff and
the administration.
Collegiality is one of the precious benefits of our vocation, sustaining us
personally and professionally and, at best, advancing our collective interests. New
communications technology is:a wonderful tool, but there is nothing that replaces’ face*toface interaction. Two hours every other week is all it takes to be part of the’Senafe’ If
you are absent, you miss a lot, and the Senate’s misses you—an important measure me its
strength.
ee
You probably have already received’a schedule ‘of Senate meetings. ‘The agenda
for the first meeting, Friday September 10 at 12:30 P. m., is enclosed, as are the minutes
of the last Senate meeting for your review.
I hope to see you there.
Sincerely,

Caroline Sawyer
Senate Chair/ Dept. of Humanities and Languages (X 3115)
