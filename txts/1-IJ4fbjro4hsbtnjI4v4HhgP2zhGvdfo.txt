Resolution for the Revision Process of Minors and Micro-Credentials
WHEREAS, currently, the College has no policy concerning revising minors and microcredentials, and
WHEREAS, creating a new minor or micro-credential requires a review by the Curriculum and
Academic Planning (CAP) Committee and an approval of the Faculty Senate, and
WHEREAS, the College has an established policy for revising degree and certificate programs,
and
WHEREAS, changes in learning demands, academic trends, and institutional goals over time
make adjustments to existing minors and micro-credentials necessary and desirable
at times, and
WHEREAS, revisions to academic programs that are so drastic that would transform their
nature, direction or overall curricular structure warrant college-wide discussions
and consultations,

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that revisions to a minor or micro-credential program that
would alter over 50% of the current curricular requirements shall be subject to a
CAP Committee review and Faculty Senate approval, and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that other revisions to a minor or micro-credential program do
not require a review and approval by the Faculty Governance, as long as the
support from all contributing or affected academic departments is granted.
