DATE: April 10th, 2020
SUBJECT: Supplements to CR/NC A-B-C Grading Scale

RATIONALE:
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the transition to all online classes is unprecedented and calls for
unprecedented solutions to new academic challenges,
WHEREAS grading accommodations, considering the State of Emergency caused by COVID-19, seek
to address the plethora of issues students face in the various spaces they seek refuge,
DEEPLY DISTURBED New York State is the most afflicted state in the nation for COVID-19 with
roughly 5% of cases worldwide 1 and 58% of cases in the country2 ,
FULLY AWARE students experienced a disruption to the remaining 57% of their semester, including
midterms and finals week,
WHEREAS students are operating under extraordinary circumstances both tangible and intangible
which will consequently be reflected on their transcripts,
NOTING WITH APPRECIATION the CR/NC option will be of great help to any students that are solely
taking classes that have no letter grade requirements,
NOTING FURTHER that a C- or better is a mandated prerequisite for many upper-division courses in
order to meet the competency requirement in the major3 ,
POINTING OUT a student may not repeat certain courses more than once4
RECOGNIZING multiple program policies currently require a minimum departmental GPA
AFFIRMING the 2018-2023 SUNY Old Westbury Strategic Plan explains the promotion of “social
justice and equality in living and learning through its historic commitment to educational
empowerment, diversity, access, equity”5,
KEEPING IN MIND many graduate schools, occupations, professional schools, fellowships,
certifications and more require letter grades for students to be applicable,

DEEPLY CONCERNED that if students decide on CR/NC they are at risk of compromising their
financial aid and/or immigration status,

RESOLUTION:
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that we supplement CR/NC with a wider grading range to
accommodate students who are not positioned to take CR/NC,
RECOMMENDS the following A-B-C grading range:
A
B
C

100-87
86-74
73-60

FURTHER RECCOMENDS to waive all letter grade requirements for Spring 2020 semester in

each department (i.e. needing a C- or higher to satisfy major),
TRUSTS the faculty to endorse a grading range that considers the 57% of the semester students will
face without the instruction, space, or guidance they anticipated,
EXPRESSES ITS HOPE that the spirit of SUNY College at Old Westbury guides your decision as
students traverse through this pandemic in pursuit of their academic endeavors.
