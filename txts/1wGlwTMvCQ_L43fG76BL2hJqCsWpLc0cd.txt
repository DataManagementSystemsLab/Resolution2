Dear Dr. Colon-Urban and Members of the Faculty Senate:
It is critical that I focus on the financial challenge facing the College at Old Westbury.
Recent discussions with SUNY officials indicate the possibility of assistance beyond the
$3.3 million subsidy committed for fiscal year 2002-2003. This week I am scheduled to
meet with the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees

Finance Committee, and I also have the opportunity to engage in a discussion with the
Governor. I am committed to sharing the seriousness of the impact of the long term lack
of resources suffered by the College.
Due to these meetings, I've made many last minute adjustments to my calendar including
the cancellation of my attendance at the Faculty Senate meeting scheduled for Friday,
November Ist at 12:30pm.
Please accept my apologies.

Thank you.

Sifferely,

r. Calvin O. Butts, III

President
