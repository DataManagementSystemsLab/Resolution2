Resolution:
Health-Threatening Conditions: Mold
Whereas, health-threatening, dangerous mold has been found in the TV studio, affecting
ceilings, walls, and costly equipment regularly handled by students and faculty, and;
Whereas, protecting the students, faculty and staff from the potentially of mold contamination
requires relocating our TV facility, staff, interns, volunteers, and classes;
Whereas, new mold has just been identified on the H-VAC system potentially
affecting a much larger population in Campus Center, and
Whereas, mold is currently being addressed in the residence halls with strong measures
including cleanup, new mold-resistant filters and high-powered dehumidifiers among others;
Be it resolved that the College immediately employ what OSHA designates as "licensed mold
assessors" to conduct a "licensed mold assessment" of the G-wing area of Campus Center and
other areas known to be affected by mold on campus, in compliance with county, state, and federal
standards.
