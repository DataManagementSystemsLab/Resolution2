III. Activities
Meetings
In the fall 2021 semester the Committee held three online meetings (9/9, 10/12, 11/23), and continue to
carry out its work online. Four members of the Committee (C. DeVirgilio, B. Hillery, C, Hope, J. Spadaro)
also serve as Leads on campus for SUNY’s OER initiatives and attend online meetings with SUNY OER
Services.
Registered OER Courses – Fall 2021
The Committee reviews OER course syllabi and course materials to determine whether they meet
SUNY’s requirements to be designated as an OER course and identified with the OER attribute in the
course registration system. A course section is designated as OER if more than 50% of the assigned

course materials is comprised of Open Educational Resources. This designation is on a semester-bysemester basis and is at the discretion of the instructors/departments. The following updated table
shows the number of courses by departments that were registered in our system and with SUNY for
summer and fall 2021. There was a total of 4 summer and 30 fall courses registered. Seven of all those
courses (1 summer [CP], 6 fall [1-BS, 5-CP]) were newly developed OER course sections. Twenty-seven
were repeated courses that were taught in prior semesters. The Chemistry and Physics department
developed the greatest number of OER courses for this period.

Registered OER Courses – Winter & Spring 2022
On September 22, 2021, the Committee sent an email to faculty asking for their draft winter/spring
2022 syllabi for review if they wanted to have the courses identified as OER in the registration system.
As of this writing, there are 2 winter and 26 spring courses registered. Faculty may still submit their
draft winter/spring syllabi to the Committee for review and tagging.

Campus Events/Professional Development
Making your way with Waymaker: Using an Evidence-based Learning Management Platform for
Introductory Classes, November 3, 2021
This event was co-sponsored by the Teaching, Learning, and Resources Committee and Ad Hoc OER
Faculty Committee. Drs. Mukherji and Jović shared “their experience of using an interactive and
dynamic OER platform, Lumen Learning's Waymaker. This platform has been designed using the
evidence-based principles of iterative learning and is continuously updated, based on student
performance data. Consistent interaction with students and feedback is built into the platform which
boosts student engagement, with little extra effort required to maintain it, on the part of the faculty
member.” (Flyer)
IV. Future Planning
Members of the committee would like to assist all OW faculty as much as possible in their adoption of
OER material in their classes. However, it is hard to know what type of help faculty members actually
need. To this end, we are planning to prepare a short faculty survey that will hopefully inform us better
about what are the major obstacles facing faculty in adopting OER material and how the committee can
be of better help.
Making the OER LibGuide (https://libguides.oldwestbury.edu/oer) more visible and more easily
accessible.
Organizing a showcase and/or a workshop on how to create and use OER material in our upper level
courses.
Organizing an event with and for the students about OER needs and opportunities.
