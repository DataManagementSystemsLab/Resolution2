Below is a summary of the information and advice communicated to the College by our Middle States Liaison, Vice President, Dr. Terence Peavy, during a Zoom meeting on August 3, at 12:30 pm.  The topic of the meeting was the June 24, 2021 action by the Middle States Commission, which requested a Supplemental Information Report by March 1, 2022.  Below are the seven substantive areas regarding which the Commission requested “further evidence”; Dr. Peavy’s information and advice are identified by the arrow-bullets (→) beneath each substantive area, in green text.



"To request a supplemental information report, due March 1, 2022, documenting further evidence of: 



the periodic assessment of the effectiveness of student learning opportunities (Standard III, criterion 8)  

This evidence will have significant overlap with numbers 3, 4, 5, and 7, below – especially #7 because of the importance of “closing the loop” activities, and will draw on the plans described in the College’s Institutional Response, as modified to meet – to the extent possible – the March 1, 2022 reporting deadline;

the periodic assessment of the effectiveness of student support programs and experiences (Standard IV, criterion 6)  

This evidence should include a comprehensive institutional (non-academic) assessment review, with special attention to the bearing on student support and experiences;

clearly stated institutional and program-level goals which are aligned with each other and with the institution’s mission (Standard V, criterion 1)  

This evidence will reflect the ongoing process of clarifying and strengthening the College’s program-level student learning outcomes, as outlined in the Self-Study Report;

organized and systematic assessments that evaluate the extent of student achievement (Standard V, criterion 2)  

This evidence will have significant overlap with numbers 1 (above) and 5, and 7, below – especially #7 because of the importance of “closing the loop” activities, and will draw on the plans described in the College’s Institutional Response, as modified to meet – to the extent possible – the March 1, 2022 reporting deadline;

organized and systematic assessments that evaluate the extent of student achievement in general education (Standard V, criterion 2)  

This evidence will rely on the sections of the College’s Institutional Response that refer explicitly to the assessment of Liberal Education Program (LEP) student learning outcomes (most notable Appendix 1), with special attention to evidence demonstrating progress in “closing the loop” activities (see #7, below);

sufficient support to sustain the assessment of student achievement and to communicate results of assessment to stakeholders (Standard V, criterion 2c) 

This evidence will include the investments and resources allocated to:

Obtain campus-wide assessment technology (e.g., Weave+),

Fund the full cost of the Assessment Fellows Program (as much as $68,000),

Commitment to fully staffing the offices and units responsible for coordinating Academic and Institutional Assessment;

demonstrated and documented use of assessment results to improve educational effectiveness (Standard V, criterion 3)."

As we have academic departments that are in various stages of the assessment process, we should aim to provide evidence that demonstrates the College’s best, sustained efforts at achieving progress towards the goals identified in the Evaluation Team’s Report and the Institutional Response.  Thus, the further evidence provided in response to Criterion 3 of Standard V will be neither a status update of the College’s progress en route to the deadlines identified in the Institutional Response nor a full cycle of completed academic assessments for all relevant campus areas (e.g., academic departments, the LEP domains).  The College should therefore provide further evidence that:

Documentation of “closing the loop” activities are now being documented,

Documentation of progress in both program (department-based) and institutional (LEP) academic assessments continues per the status reported in the Self-Study Report:

academic areas that have completed assessments will demonstrate use of those assessments, as well as documentation of such use;

academic areas that have established appropriate student learning outcomes will demonstrate effective measurement of achievement (as a necessary step in preparation for using the assessment data, and documenting that use;

academic areas where student learning outcomes require additional revision and refining will proceed with that, per their academic assessment planning documents;

A full cycle of academic assessment for all departments and programs is neither expected nor realistic.
