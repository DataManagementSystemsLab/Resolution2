Ad Hoc Open Educational Resources (OER) Committee
Committee Objectives
The Committee was constituted for the purposes of:
• Creating policies and procedures for developing and implementing OER curricula;
• Assessing course syllabi to determine whether they qualify to be designated an OER course,
according to established criteria;
• Setting policies for the allocation of SUNY OER funding (as available) to support campus OER
initiatives;
• Assessing needs and recommending resources to support faculty teaching OER courses;
• Cultivating resources to support the College’s OER programs;
• Developing relationships across the campus to sustain a long-­­term OER program; and
• Reporting to the Senate at least once each semester on OER activities, promotion, and
sustainability initiatives.
What is OER?
OER are teaching, learning, and research materials that reside in the public domain or have been
released under an intellectual property license that permits repurposing by others—and therefore
are free or low-cost to students. “OER often have a Creative Commons or GNU license that state
specifically how the material may be used, reused, adapted, and shared" (OER Commons).
Fall Activities
• Planning to co-organize a presentation by faculty who teach with OER.
• Review draft syllabi for winter/spring courses to determine if they meet the criteria to be
registered as OER courses in the registration system and with SUNY.
• Hoping to collaborate on an event with the SGA.
