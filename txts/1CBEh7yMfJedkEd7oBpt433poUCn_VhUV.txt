To the Faculty Senate Leadership:





	I will be unable to attend the Faculty Senate meeting on February 9, 2018 due to prior commitments in California. I have named Asia Burke Senator for the College of Professional Studies for the Student Government Association as my proxy for the Faculty Senate Meeting on February 9, 2018 in the New Academic Building Room 1100.



With Regards, 



Evan Rufrano
