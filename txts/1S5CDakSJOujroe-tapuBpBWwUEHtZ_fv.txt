November 10, 2021

Whereas by Resolution 98-241, adopted on December 15, 1998,
the SUNY Board of Trustees established a SUNY General
Education Requirement for all baccalaureate students; and
Whereas by Resolution 2010-006, adopied.on January 19, 2010,
the SUNY Board of Trustees enhanced flexibility in the SUNY
General Education Requirement; and

Whereas by Resolution 2012-089, adopted on December 17,

November 10, 2021

Whereas the current SUNY General Education Requirement

does not include A.A.S. and A.O.S. degrees, align fully with

Middle States Accreditation Standards or NYS Commissioner's

Regulations, address Diversity, Equity, inclusion, and Social

Justice; and is outdated in other ways; and

Whereas the SUNY Board of Trustees has elevated the

importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and social justice in

SUNY by creating a standing Board Committee, and the

Chancellor has made it a top priority for all campuses, faculty,

staff, and students by initiating the 25-step Diversity, Equity, and
Inclusion Action Plan that includes general education; and
Whereas the proposed SUNY General Education Framework
aligns with the Middle States Commission on Higher Education
accreditation Standards for general education and New York
State Education Department liberal arts and sciences
requirements for degrees; and
Whereas the proposed SUNY General Education Framework’s
updated knowledge, skills, and core competencies are
necessitated by increasingly rapid change in academia,
business, and social discourse; and
Whereas the proposed SUNY General Education Framework
continues to ensure seamless transfer, and successful transfer
for SUNY students continues to be consistent with SUNY’s
strategic and master plans since 1972 and is of central
importance to increasing degree completion and closing New
York State’s degree attainment gap; and
Whereas the SUNY General Education Framework should be

applicable to all SUNY undergraduate degree programs, address
the fundamental goals of higher education, including proficiency
with essential skills, familiarization with disciplinary and
interdisciplinary ways of knowing, and enhancement of the
values and disposition of an engaged 21st century global
citizenry; now, therefore, be it

Resolved that the Board of Trustees recognizes the broadly
representative individuals who participated in the research and
design phases of the general education policy revision process
and applauds their hard work and dedication; and, be it further

Attachment A. SUNY General Education Framework

Attachment B. Provost's General Education Advisory Committee (GEAC)
Charge, and Committee and Subcommittee Composition

Background
I. SUNY General Education Requirement History
The SUNY Board of Trustees established a 30-credit SUNY General Education
Requirement (SUNY GER) for all baccalaureate students, including ten required
academic areas and two required competency areas, by adopting Resolution 98241 on December 15, 1998. The purpose was to provide an intellectual
foundation, ensure curricular depth, and encourage academic exploration across
disciplines.
On January 19, 2010, the Board enhanced flexibility in the SUNY General
Education Requirement by adopting Resolution 2010-006. This maintained the
required 30-credits but reduced the number of required academic areas from ten
to seven, with mathematics and basic communication required, as well as at

least five of the following eight academic areas: natural science, social science,

American history, Western Civilization, Other World Civilizations, humanities, the

arts, and foreign languages.

. some academic areas.

This enabled students to take multiple courses in

Consistent with SUNY’s long-standing commitment to transfer student success

and because A.A. and A.S. programs are designed as transfer degrees, in 2012

the Board added those degrees to the current SUNY General Education

Requirement by adopting Resolution 2012-089. Thereby, each curriculum
leading to an A.A., A.S., and bachelor’s degree shall enable students to complete

seven of ten SUNY General Education Requirement academic areas (including
mathematics and basic communication), two competency areas, and 30 credits
of SUNY General Education courses.

These requirements are to be completed

in the first two years of full-time study (or 60 credits, whichever is greater), so that

associate degree students make progress equal to baccalaureate students.
ll. SUNY General Education Requirement Revision Process

Recognizing that the SUNY General Education Requirement included outdated
language, did not include some degrees, was out of alignment with accreditation
requirements, and that some campuses were revising their local requirements,
the SUNY Provost convened a shared governance advisory group, comprised of
12 UFS, FCCC, and SA governance representatives; six SUNY provosis, three
System administrators, and a Distinguished Academy member, to a one-day |

Board Resolution

6

November 10, 2023

SUNY General Education Requirement Retreat (on 5/23/17), to consider whether

SUNY GER needed to be revised. The broadly representative participants at this
pre-planning retreat advised that it was time to revisit the SUNY General
Education Requirement and offered suggestions for a three-phase
comprehensive review process and initial guiding principles.
Phase I of the SUNY GER review was led by the presidents of the University
Faculty Senate and the Faculty Council of Community Colleges. This working
group was composed predominately of faculty selected by the co-chairs and
charged with and the analysis of national, system, accreditation, and SUNY

campus models of general education. After two years of study, the working group

produced a White Paper that reported on the larger issues and a Green Paper
that made recommendations; and

Phase || was led by the SUNY Provost's General Education Advisory Committee

(GEAC), co-chaired by a Chief Academic Officer and a Distinguished Teaching

Professor, comprised of ten faculty members and a broad representation of
other impacted stakeholders, charged with developing initial recommendations
for a general education framework in the context of a proposed policy revision

(see Attachment B). Informed by the faculty-governance work from Phase 1, the

full membership of GEAC reviewed its subcommittee work and prepared a draft
General Education Framework which the Provost disseminated throughout the
SUNY System, resulting in robust campus feedback. Working collaboratively with
faculty governance leaders and other experts, the Provost’s team analyzed the
voluminous feedback to refine the Framework for the Provost's consideration. On
September 8, 2021, Provost-in-Charge Sandvik distributed the refined SUNY —

General Education Framework and draft guidance, and invited campus feedback
on draft implementation guidance.

Phase Ill is implementation of the new SUNY General Education Framework
(Attachment A). Through local shared governance processes, campuses shall

implement the SUNY General Education framework in accordance with all

applicable SUNY policies, Middle States Commission on Higher Education

accreditation standards, and New York State Education Department regulations
and procedures. SUNY System Administration will publish implementation

guidance in the form of a Provosi’s Memorandum to Presidents. Campuses shall

refer to these guidelines, which will establish the consistency needed to ensure

seamless transfer, while allowing the flexibility for campuses to meet the needs

of their students.

SUNY Provost Office staff will provide ongoing guidance and

continuing oversight of general education policy implementation.

SUNY GENERAL EDUCATION FRAMEWORK
SUNY GENERAL EDUCATION VISION STATEMENT
The State University of New York’s overarching goal is to empower students to meet the
changing demands of the 21st-century. Embedded in this goal are SUNY’s commitment to broad
access to thehighest quality education, deep and engaged learning, and overall student success.
SUNY General Education supports these goals by creating a system-wide framework—applicable to

all SUNY undergraduate degree programs—that addresses the fundamental aims of postsecondary
undergraduate education, including proficiency with essential skills and competencies,
familiarization with disciplinary and interdisciplinary ways of knowing, and enhancement of the
values and dispositionof an engaged 21% century global citizenry.

Moreover, SUNY General Education promotes equity by equipping SUNY undergraduates, regardless of
background, program of study, or campus, with foundational capacities fostered through a broad
liberal education to prepare them for further study, work, life, and global citizenship.

It encourages

students toexplore subjects and learning experiences beyond their intended major and fosters a
commitment to personal growth and life-long learning.
Importantly, SUNY General Education supports seamless transfer of students between and among
SUNYinstitutions and it ensures consistency in expected system-level learning outcomes while
enabling individual campuses to develop unique signature features, including their respective array

of educational offerings and pedagogical approaches.
STATEMENT OF VALUES AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES
SUNY General Education (GE) is a system-wide framework applicable to all SUNY undergraduate
degree programs that addresses the fundamental goals of higher education, including proficiency
with essentialskills, familiarization with disciplinary and interdisciplinary ways of knowing, and

enhancement of the values and disposition of an engaged 21% century global citizenry.
SUNY’s General Education rests on the following guiding principles:
1.

SUNY GE promotes equity by equipping all SUNY undergraduates—regardless of
background, program

of study, or campus—with foundational capacities fostered through

a broad liberal education to prepare them for further study, work, life, and global
citizenship.

2.

SUNY GE encourages students to explore subjects and learning experiences beyond their
intendedmajor and fosters a commitment to personal growth and life-long learning.

3.

SUNY GE aligns with SUNY’s commitment to deep and engaged learning and encourages
persistence,completion, and success.

4.

SUNY GE supports seamless transfer of students between and among SUNY institutions; it
ensuresconsistency in expected learning outcomes while enabling individual campuses to

develop unique signature features, including their respective array of educational offerings
and pedagogical approaches.

Attachment A
5.

SUNY GE specifies minimum requirements; campuses may set additional expectations, as

long asthose expectations remain consistent with SUNY policy, NYS regulation and education
law, and institutional accreditation standards and expectations.

6.

SUNY GE is internally consistent and coherent, and readily understood by students, faculty,
staff,and other internal and external stakeholders.

7.

SUNY GE includes clear and measurable student learning outcomes, assessed by campuses on an

ongoing basis to ensure high-quality educational experiences for all undergraduate students;
similarly, SUNY GE policy is reviewed regularly to ensure that it is effective, relevant, and up-todate.

Attachment A

OVERVIEW OF THE SUNY GENERAL EDUCATION FRAMEWORK
The SUNY GE framework includes twelve categories of knowledge, skills and competencies—ten
knowledge and skills areas expose students to different ways of knowing so that they can make
reasoned judgements outside as well as inside their academic field, and enabling them to develop
diverse perspectives and global understanding; and two core competencies that extend beyond
discipline-specific knowledge and skills. Among the specific knowledge and skills categories is a new
requirement, Diversity: Equity, Inclusion, and Social Justice. This requirement aligns with the SUNY
Boardof Trustees’ Policy on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (adopted September 10, 2015) as well as
SUNY’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Phase | Action Plan (2021), which recommends including a

diversity category in the general education requirements. In addition, explicitly delineated skills and
competencies in quantitative reasoning, scientific reasoning, oral and written communication, critical
thinking and reasoning, and information literacy help to ensure SUNY graduates have the 21st
century knowledge, skills, and competencies they need, while also satisfying institutional

accreditation expectations. Finally, the framework provides flexibility for campuses to develop
innovative and robust local genera! education programs for their respective undergraduate degrees.

PROVOST’S GENERAL EDUCATION ADVISORY COMMITTEE (GEAC)
SUNY General Education for the 21st Century Provost’s General Education Advisory Committee Charge
The Provost’s General Education Advisory Committee (GEAC) shall be a shared-governance committee

that advises the SUNY Provost on SUNY’s General Education Requirements for baccalaureate- and
associate-degree students. Building on SUNY ‘Board of Trustees’ policy and the environmental scan and

recommendations of the Phase | Working Group (summarized in the White Paper and in the Green
Paper), the GEAC will prepare a broad SUNY general education vision statement that reflects SUNY’s
overarching goal of empowering students to meet the changing demands of a 21st-century global

citizen. The vision should align with SUNY’s statutory mission to broadly educate its students and accord
with key priorities, including diversity, sustainability, individualized education, innovation, and
partnerships. Based on this vision, the GEAC will develop policy recommendations for a cohesive
University-wide general education framework by spring 2021, with intermediate reporting requirements

in the spring of 2020 and fall of 2020. The framework shall align with the MSCHE’s criteria for general
education by offering sufficient scope to draw students into new areas of intellectual experience. The
General Education plan must be flexible to allow for individual campus innovation and reinforcement of
their distinctive missions, goals, and cultures. Innovative GE approaches approved by the campus and

SUNY must be fully transferable as GE completed components to other SUNY institutions. These general
principles shall guide GEAC’s endeavors.
As recommended by the Phase | Working Group in the Green Paper, particular attention should be given
to the following topics and issues:
¢

Reconsideration of the designation of the Information Management category as an infused
competency and revision of the accompanying learning outcomes;

*

Development of more culturally sensitive language in the titles of knowledge and skills areas and
their related learning outcomes, with urgent reconsideration of the “Other World Civilizations”
and “Foreign Language” category titles;

¢

Cross-disciplinary examination of the (MSCHE) scientific reasoning requirement and its

relationship to a possible natural sciences general education requirement for all;
¢

Stipulation that a student may use a general education course to fulfill a maximum of two SUNY
general education categories;

¢

Consideration of methods for addressing general education in AAS and AOS degrees;

¢

Reconsideration of SUNY general education categories and their related student learning
outcomes, including whether to maintain the number of content categories at ten and the

¢

seven-category requirement for all SUNY students;
Consideration of the options for required general education credits for AA/AS degrees (e.g.,
maintain the 30-credit requirement or reduce the number of required credits);

e¢

Development of a sustainable pian for cyclical review and assessment of the SUNY general
education program.

Allowing for substantive stakeholder feedback to revise and inform the work {as detailed in the
proposed General Education Phase II Timeline), the GEAC shall complete its work by the first quarter of
2021, with important intermediate progress updates due by Apri! 2020 and October 2020.
