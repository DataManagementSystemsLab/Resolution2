Resolution on Establishing Limits to the Use of Credit/No Credit Toward Degree Completion



Whereas there is currently no specified limit on the number of Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) courses that can be used toward students’ degree at SUNY College at Old Westbury (OW); and



Whereas some other SUNY-affiliated colleges have set limits to the number of credits that can be fulfilled by a CR/NC or P/F option; and



Whereas an increasing number of students have become aware of the option of selecting the CR/NC option since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic; and



Whereas it is recognized by faculty that the student population at OW disproportionately faces socio-structural obstacles (financial, familial, etc.) to academic success, especially since the start of the pandemic; and



Whereas providing some limited degree of academic flexibility to students to help them overcome barriers to completing their degrees is therefore consistent with the social justice mission of the college; and



Whereas it is also imperative that OW maintains high academic standards in order to facilitate the intellectual and professional growth of its students; and 



Whereas the option of CR/NC may lead some students to put less than full effort into their work for those courses for which this option is selected (since, for example, receiving a D will provide credit for the course without negatively impacting the students’ GPA, and may therefore lead some students to only do the bare minimum to pass courses for which CR/NC option is selected); and



Whereas excessive use of the CR/NC option may therefore act as an overall impediment to students’ academic development;



Be it resolved, that SUNY College at Old Westbury limit the number of credits that can count towards a student’s degree from courses for which the CR/NC option is selected to 16; that no more than 8 credits earned from CR/NC courses can count towards degree completion per one academic year; and no more than 4 credits earned from CR/NC course can count towards degree completion per semester; and



Be it also resolved that Schools and Departments have flexibility to establish additional restrictions on the selection of the CR/NC option for students in their respective programs; and 



Be it also resolved that students be strongly encouraged (but not mandated) to consult with an adviser from their School or Department before selecting CR/NC for any course.
