Resolution on HVAC-related Conditions in Academic Village

Background:

In January 1998, NYSERDA (the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority)

began providing planning, analysis and technical assistance for SUNY Old Westbury, detailing how the campus
could be transformed into a model of energy efficiency and energy conservation, through state-of-the art equipment
and energy management practices. The envisioned project included replacement of HVAC equipment campus-wide
as well as potential initiatives in photovoltaic energy and cogeneration. The envisioned project also included

educational components to connect renewable energy and “sustainability” initiatives with academic research,

student internships and multi-disciplinary curriculum. Since 1998, funding for this project has been available
through NYSERDA’s State EnVest program - with no upfront costs to the institution - through an energy
performance contract in which physical plant upgrades are paid for by future energy savings.’

Following delays caused by two changes in administration, NYSERDA issued an RFP for the SUNY Old Westbury
comprehensive energy efficiency project in February 2000. A two-stage evaluation process was conducted in
March 2000 and June 2000 for proposals submitted in response to the RFP. An award-winning energy services
company, Sempra Energy, was selected by the project team on the basis of technical merit, financial merit and
overall vision of energy conservation. The project team was comprised of two campus staff (one each from
Facilities and Office of Business & Finance), one faculty member with a background in energy analysis, and
engineers from NYSERDA and SAIC (Science Applications International Corporation).

Based on NYSERDA’s experiences with comprehensive energy projects at other SUNY campuses and K-12

institutions, an overall two-year time period was projected from initial stages of planning through completion of all

construction. (In their June 2000 proposal in response to NYSERDA’s RFP, Sempra Energy projected the

completion of construction by August 2001.) These timelines, however, assumed an appropriate degree of focus,
attentiveness and cooperation on the part of campus administration which did not materialize.

In early 2002, frustrated by lack of progress and ongoing administrative indifference, NYSERDA removed their
project manager assigned to the Old Westbury campus since 1998, re-directing their efforts to other SUNY
campuses and institutions seeking their assistance. SAIC continued to provide analysis and technical assistance
through Summer 2003, culminating in a cogeneration feasibility study undertaken with an Old Westbury faculty
member funded by a NYSERDA research grant.
By summer 2004, the Academic Village chiller unit was completely inoperable. Indoor temperatures near 90°F,

with stifling humidity and inadequate ventilation, were experienced in the AV offices of department secretaries and

faculty teaching over the summer. To alleviate the hardship of these conditions, the administration provided but an
empty “cooling room” in a vacant dormitory. Department secretaries could not realistically do their work from this
location, since the nature of their work makes them “first responders” to problems brought to department offices by
all constituencies on campus. When secretaries purchased their own air conditioners or faculty purchased AC units
for them by pooling their own funds, facilities workers were prevented by their supervisors from installing these
units on compensated time. Some of these workers volunteered to install these units on their own time.
Months prior to Summer 2004, sections of the A-wing had been closed off and boarded up, due to the danger of the
air-conditioning unit collapsing through the roof. (Closure of sections of the A-wing has severely impeded access to
the Mathematics & Computer Information Sciences Department, which lies just beyond the “forbidden zone”,
having been moved to the A-wing from the B-wing last fall.) During this entire time period, there has been no
meaningful information to affected employees in Academic Village regarding the dangers, impacts or plans related

to failed equipment and infrastructure.

At the September 13, 2004 meeting of the Executive Committee with Dr. Butts it was learned that the College had
[in May 2004] contracted with Sempra Energy to begin work on campus-wide energy projects, with the crane that

recently appeared outside Academic Village evidence that replacement of the AV chiller was under way.

' The financing of energy efficiency upgrades and related services, in whole or in part, through an energy performance contract
is described in NYSERDA Report 98-15, Public Sector Energy Performance Contracting in New York State.

a)

Whereas building managers and administrators have the responsibility to provide working conditions that do not

compromise the health and safety of employees, and

6) Whereas extreme indoor temperature fluctuations and poor ventilation are known to impede employee

productivity, pose certain health risks, adversely affect morale, and in academic buildings also adversely affect
perceived institutional quality and student retention; and
c) Whereas problems associated with the College’s poorly maintained and failing HVAC equipment have been
well-documented over the past decade (in both internal and externally generated reports), including problems

related to physical discomfort, indoor air quality, wasted energy and wasted fiscal resources - with SUNY Old

Westbury’s energy consumption and costs running 40% above energy efficient levels; and,

a) Whereas, during Summer 2004, inoperable HVAC systems in AV jeopardized the health and safety of affected
college staff, especially department secretaries whose work is essential to the functioning of the College; and,

e) Whereas, the 2003-2008 Campus Capital Plan was developed by a collegewide committee throughout 2001,

using an open, inclusive process facilitated by the SUNY Construction Fund and consulting architects, planners and
engineers, with this Capital Plan ranking as a top priority critical maintenance projects in Academic Village
(including HVAC upgrades in Academic Village and throughout the campus), with the express assumption that

Capital Plan projects would be integrated with the comprehensive energy project planned through NYSERDA; and,

J) Whereas, under the project envisioned by NYSERDA and Sempra Energy (in their March and June 2000
responses to NYSERDA’s

RFP), Old Westbury was poised to become a leader within SUNY

and the Northeast, as

a model campus for energy conservation, but now, four years after Sempra’s [then] visionary proposal was selected,

important elements of the comprehensive project planned through NYSERDA have not been pursued by the

administration (e.g., photovoltaic energy in the Campus Center Atrium; educational linkage of energy/environment
“sustainability” initiatives with academic research, internships and multi-disciplinary curriculum), and one-time
opportunities for related extramural funding (e.g., LIPA proposed geothermal project, 2001-02) have been lost; and,
g)

Whereas, the Executive Committee recently learned that Sempra has begun work on HVAC upgrades; therefore,

h) Be It Resolved that the Faculty Senate respectfully urges the Administration to provide all needed

support to expedite completion of Sempra Energy’s campuswide projects, in coordination with critical
maintenance projects identified and prioritized in the 2003-2008 Campus Capital Plan; and,
i) Be It Further Resolved that the Faculty Senate respectfully urges the Administration to provide open,

regular and complete communication with all campus constituencies regarding the timelines, impacts and
disruptions related to the ongoing construction; and,

j) Be It Further Resolved that the Faculty Senate commends the department secretaries and other college
staff, for their dedication and valiant efforts during the summer of 2004, when forced to work under
conditions of extreme physical discomfort caused by inoperable HVAC systems in Academic Village; and,
k) Belt Further Resolved

that the Faculty Senate commends

the facilities workers who volunteered their

own time to help colleagues in distress, and that the Faculty Senate requests that the Administration likewise
expressly commend the above-mentioned staff; and,
m) Be It Further Resolved that the Faculty Senate requests that the cost of air conditioners purchased with
employees’ personal funds be matched by the Administration through their donation of a corresponding sum
to the Student Scholarship Fund.
