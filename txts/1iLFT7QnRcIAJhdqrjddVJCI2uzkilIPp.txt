Line Request Reviews

CAP Committee conducted the second Line Request Review since the revival of the practice in AY20192020. In Fall 2020, the Committee revised the procedure to improve the process. The Committee decided
to implement a two-meetings review process so that CAP will have an opportunity to clarify questions
with Academic Departments between reviewing requests and the final voting.
By the end of January, the CAP Committee received fourteen line requests from nine academic
departments. After reviewing and discussing each request, CAP sent recommendations to the Provost in
March. CAP recommendations and the review procedure are included in the Appendix.
After the submission of recommendations, CAP members met to discuss ways to further refine the
procedure. After discussions, the Committee voted to 1) remove letter ratings from recommendations and
2) add more qualitative justifications for recommendations.

IV.

Curriculum and Academic Planning Policies

In AY2020-2021, the CAP Committee submitted three resolutions to refine the approval and revision
process of internal degrees. These proposals clarify 1) timing of activation for a new micro-credential, 2)
credit transfer limit for micro-credentials, 3) micro-credential time frame, and 4) the approval process of
major revisions to existing minor and micro-credential programs. All of these resolutions (included in the
Appendix) were approved by the Faculty Senate.

V.

Other Activities

The CAP Committee reviewed the School of Professional Studies (SPS) Faculty Advisory Committee
Annual Review Report (Oct 16) and the Micro-Credentials First Year Report (Nov 13). The Committee
voted to accept both reports.

Line Request Recommendations
Spring 2021
The CAP Committee received fourteen (14) line requests from nine (9) academic departments. After
careful review and discussion of each line, CAP decided that critical and immediate needs and/or strong
merits are clearly demonstrated for eight (8) of these lines, and needs and merits are clearly demonstrated
for five (5) lines.
Procedure
The CAP Chair emailed department chairs to solicit line requests for the next academic year hiring on
November 25, 2020. Reference materials were shared with the chairs on January 8, 2021. By January 25,
2021 the total of fourteen line requests were submitted from nine academic departments and programs via
online form. These requests were compiled and circulated among CAP members on January 29, 2021.
CAP Committee members discussed requests on Feb 8 and asked for additional information from some
departments. On Feb 22, CAP members discussed responses and casted anonymous votes via Microsoft
Forms. Each line request was classified into one of the following three categories.
Critical and immediate need/Strong merit of the line is clearly demonstrated [A]
Need and merit of the line is clearly demonstrated [B]
Need and merit of the line is not clearly demonstrated [C]
Members recused themselves from voting for a line request from their own department in order to avoid
the conflict of interest.

CAP Recommendations: Departments with a Single Line Request
Six department requested a single line. Upon reviewing these requests, CAP Committee believes all
department demonstrated clear needs and merits and that they deserve the resource they requested. In
particular, the CAP Committee acknowledges lines requested for Mental Health Counseling
(Psychology), Childhood Special Ed (Exceptional Education), Population (Biological Sciences), Taxation
(Accounting, Taxation, Business Law), US Lit (English) are in critical and immediate need. The
Committee considered Mental Health Counseling program’s need for accreditation to be critical, and the
lack of resources at Exceptional Education and Accounting, Taxation & Business Law at the face of a
growing number of majors to be serious. The Committee also considered that the very high adjunct ratio
of English Department needs to be swiftly addressed and resolved.

Recommendations: Departments with Multiple Line Requests
Three departments (Chemistry and Physics, History and Philosophy, Sociology) requested multiple lines.
CAP Committee believes these departments demonstrated clear needs and merits for all lines. In
particular, CAP Committee regards the Physical Chemistry (C&P) line is in a critical need, considering a
certification requirement. Two new lines Sociology Department requested are also considered critical, as
the lack of resource is currently preventing the approved program to start.
