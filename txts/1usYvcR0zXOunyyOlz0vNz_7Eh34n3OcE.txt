PREAMBLE
The SUNY PRODiG ("Promoting Recruitment, Opportunity, Diversity, Inclusion and Growth") initiative aims
to increase the representation of historically underrepresented faculty at SUNY, including underrepresented
minority faculty (“URM”) in general and women faculty of all races in STEM fields (“WSTEM”). PRODiG
initiative aims to take a comprehensive approach to increasing faculty diversity by identifying historically
underrepresented faculty, growing the pipeline of URM and WSTEM students in academic careers, insisting
that campuses employ best practices empirically proven to reduce barriers to diversity in the faculty search
process, and improving recruitment and retention processes across the campuses. The stated goals of the
PRODiG program are in part for campuses to transform their hiring processes, pipeline initiatives and faculty
retention efforts.
Old Westbury’s college-wide PRODiG committee was established in 2019. In Summer 2019 faculty
representatives on the Old Westbury PRODiG committee were appointed under the direction of college
administration. Old Westbury's existing PRODiG committee has been responsible for managing the PRODiG
plan since summer 2019. The campus needs to improve on diversity, equity and inclusion. While Old
Westbury’s mission statement highlights social justice, the campus needs to improve on diversity and inclusion
based on the data which shows a gap (31% difference) between the percentage of our students (55% in Fall
2018) and our tenure stream faculty (24% in January 2018) who are members of underrepresented minorities. In
particular, campus data illustrate that there is a stark gap in the representation of Black & Latinx faculty among
those who are tenured and tenure-track. For example, as of January 2020 Black faculty comprised only 11% and
Latinx faculty comprised only 10% of tenure stream faculty, despite the fact that Black and Latinx students
constitute majority of our students, at 24.7% and 33%, respectively. Full-time Black faculty are close to
proportionally represented only among those on the non-tenure stream (22%).
Moreover, Native Americans comprised a scant 0.68% (and 0.4 % of full-time students) although the college is
located on ceded Indigenous lands, and Asians comprised only 17% of tenure stream faculty (and 10.6% of fulltime students).
Current PRODiG faculty include Dr. Tejas Bouklas (Biological Sciences), Dr. Ángel Lara (Modern
Languages), Dr. Orquidea Morales (American Studies and Media & Communication Studies), Dr. Kinning
Poon (Biological Sciences), and Dr. Shebuti Rayana (Computer Science).
PRODiG RESOLUTION
Whereas Faculty Senate recognizes the importance of PRODiG initiatives to promote the growth of faculty
diversity, and the opportunity it offers in providing support to authentically fulfill our mission of diversity,
equity, and inclusion; and
Whereas Faculty Senate recognizes the need to improve on diversity and inclusion, narrowing the significant
gap between the percentage of our students and our tenure stream faculty who are members of underrepresented
minorities; and
Whereas Faculty Senate recognizes that as a college founded to create a more socially and racially just world,
and that follows a racial and social justice mission, our particular lack of underrepresented minorities including
Black, Latinx, & Native American faculty is deeply problematic; and

Whereas for SUNY Old Westbury to become a meaningful leader in the area of social justice, and faculty
equity, inclusion and diversity requires methodologically rigorous investigation of the experiences of URM and
WSTEM faculty; and
Whereas for SUNY Old Westbury to become a meaningful leader in the area of social justice, and faculty
equity, inclusion and diversity also requires an understanding and application of current anti-racist
interdisciplinary scholarship, particularly in the area of institutional equity; and
Whereas faculty whose scholarship centers on racial equity and antiracism are uniquely positioned to provide
heretofore uncentered yet critical expertise; and
Whereas expertise in the area of antiracism and institutional equity was not systematically elicited in prior
PRODiG committee formations at the college; and
Whereas future equity and diversity efforts are unlikely to be successful without the rigorous conceptual,
disciplinary and methodological expertise of content experts whose scholarship and practice centers in the area
of antiracism and social justice; and
Whereas until the College increases its hiring of DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) professionals with a track
record of developing and implementing successful, conceptually and methodologically rigorous strategies to
increase URM and WSTEM faculty recruitment, hiring and retention, faculty are well poised to fill in these
existing gaps; and
Whereas, faculty can help the local PRODiG program become better poised for success in terms of 1.
methodologically and conceptually rigorous research on local barriers and facilitators to URM and WSTEM
recruitment, hiring and retention, 2. rigorous inquiry into the types of programs and support that would create an
institutional environment conducive to URM and WSTEM faculty hiring and retention, 3. the development of
recommendations based on rigorous research; and
Whereas, URM faculty often are hired on contingent lines and contingent lines are the only type of line in
which Black faculty approach proportional representation; and
Whereas SUNY Old Westbury’s current PRODiG faculty (and other URM and WSTEM faculty) do not
currently receive adequate instrumental, financial, social, or material support; and
Therefore, Be It Resolved that the Faculty Senate accepts the establishment of the college-wide PRODiG
committee that: 1. sets a rigorous standard in terms of guiding towards remedying existing major gaps in the
recruitment, hiring and retention of URM and WSTEM faculty, 2. understands the intertwined nature of
diversity, equity and inclusion. 3. concretely plans for future sustainable and rigorous DEI expertise within
administrative units charged with institutional equity and diversity.
Be It Further Resolved that the college must increase investment for the professional development of PRODiG
faculty and fellows, and URM and WSTEM faculty.
Be It Further Resolved that—with required institutional support and investment—the committee will support
rigorous assessment of multi-level barriers and facilitators of PRODiG (and other URM and WSTEM) faculty
satisfaction and success, and ensure that these data are transparent and widely available.
Be It Further Resolved that the Faculty Senate endorses a 50-50 split between faculty and non-faculty members
on the college-wide PRODiG Committee.
Be It Further Resolved that a faculty Co-Chair position will be created on the PRODiG Committee, whose
authority will include convening meetings, developing PRODiG Committee meeting agendas, developing

action plans and recommendations, providing insight on whether institutional progress towards faculty
diversity, equity and inclusion goals is being made.
Be It Further Resolved that the faculty membership on the PRODiG Committee shall consist of at least 2/3
tenured faculty; all of whom will preferably have conceptual or methodological expertise (in the form of
scholarship or practice) in one or more of the following areas: 1. qualitative and quantitative social science data
collection, 2. contemporary theories of barriers and facilitators of institutional equity, 3. Black, Latinx, Asian,
Indigenous, or critical race or ethnic studies, 4. theories of anti-racist institutional transformation, 5. critical
university studies.
Be It Further Resolved that the faculty membership of PRODiG be established as above, based upon the fact
that there are currently six (6) non-faculty members. Faculty membership on the PRODiG Committee may be
updated if/when the non-faculty members are also updated to maintain the above 50-50 criteria. All departments
and schools are welcome to be part of this committee.
Be It Further Resolved that faculty shall be appointed to staggered two-year terms and faculty may serve
multiple terms.
Be It Further Resolved that the Faculty Senate strongly encourages SUNY Old Westbury to equitably and fairly
compensate faculty service work on all committees, including the PRODiG committee and others which require
a particularly intense level of faculty labor.
