MAJOR TOPICS at the PLENARY



Enrollment



This was probably the single most important topic at the plenary.  It was clearly important to Chancellor Malatras, Meryl Tisch, Chair of the Board of Trustees, and addressed by the Provost-in-Charge Sandvik in her report as well.  The decline in enrollment, which began long before the pandemic but has been exacerbated by it, is of huge concern to SUNY.  Student enrollment (aka headcount) is the “single best indicator of SUNY’s value” (Chancellor Malatras).  It is certainly an indicator of how well SUNY is doing as a business.  Chair Tisch stated that “advocating for us” and seeking funding for SUNY is at the forefront of efforts of members of the Board and the Chancellor with the NYS legislature and (now) Governor Hochul.   Chair Tisch specifically expressed urgency for funds – not only for maintaining and improving campus infrastructures but also for increasing student support services, especially mental health services and childcare.

Enrollment decline is a national phenomenon, not unique to SUNY.  A major factor in New York is a change in population growth in the state.  Specifically, enrollment decline has been observed with traditional-age college students, 18-24 years of age, and is at least partly attributed to decline in that age group within NY population.  The pandemic has resulted in additional decline more recently.  As can be seen  below, Community colleges took the greatest hit in enrollment decline, followed by the Comprehensive Colleges (which includes OW), then the Technology Centers –  from Fall 2019 (pre-covid-19 official data), to Fall 2021, based on preliminary data for Fall 2021. (Provost’s Report)

SUNY‐wide ‐10.0%

Doctoral +1.0%

Comprehensive ‐10.5%

Technology ‐9.8%

Community Colleges ‐15.4%



Figures are similar when examining enrollment for the past year, from Fall 2020 to Fall 2021 (preliminary data), with the greatest enrollment decreases in Comprehensive and Community colleges:

SUNY‐wide ‐4.7%

Doctoral +0.2%

Comprehensive ‐7.7%

Technology ‐7.4%

Community Colleges ‐6.1%

Chancellor Malatras stressed that system-wide, the largest group of students lost during the pandemic were URM students.

SUNY’s overall declining enrollment trend has been evident for a decade. The university/doctoral degree centers are doing ok, and the technology colleges are holding their own, but the Community Colleges and Comprehensive Colleges have taken the greatest enrollment hits.  [SEE two graphs below, from Provost’s Reportt.] 





Changing population growth in NY over the past decade accounts for much of the decrease in traditional-aged students.   SUNY is now targeting older “adult learners”, sometimes referred to as “life-long learners”, who are 25-44 years of age and on the rise demographically, as well as traditional-age students. (Chancellor Malatras; Provost-in-Charge Sandvik) [SEE graph below, from Provost-in-Charge Sandvik’s Report]



SUNY wants faculty innovations – in new courses, new programs, and courses that lead to credentials, such as microcredentials, as a means of attracting students, including adult learners (Chancellor and Provost-in Charge).  Both online and in-person instruction (i.e. flexibility) is also desired to better accommodate the life circumstances of students.  And now that we have gone through the pandemic pivot, many students now want both options.

SUNY is also considering making entrance exams such as SATs and GREs optional vs. required.  Many schools did not require entrance tests during the pandemic, and SUNY is now giving it greater consideration as a system-wide policy.  (Note:  The UFS has already passed a resolution in favor of this and recommending SUNY adopt such a policy.)  

Additional strategies and approaches to increase enrollment were offered by Chancellor Malatras:



local networking and outreach (for e.g. to high school guidance counselors);

even stronger student success support to facilitate academic persistence to graduation, especially in the face of life stressors and other challenging obstacles many students encounter that can disrupt their education;

refurbishing/renovating older, unused structures for use for classes or other educational programs and activities – including in neighboring (off-campus) communities that are more conveniently located for potential students in the community;

marketing strategies that will appeal to prospective students, traditional-age and adult learners; AND,

building of campus-based endowments.



The Chancellor wants to get the URM students lost during the pandemic pivot back.  He also wants the (now) 55,000 NYS residents in online degree programs in other states.  His vision of attracting new students to SUNY centers around letting potential students know they can have their choice(s) – in areas of study, in modes of education, and in movement across campuses as indicated – whether they determine such choices with the help of some type of advisement, or do so on their own using the SUNY website.



Budget



Relatively little was said about the budget, specifically the possible budget for next year. Greater discussion will take place at the Winter and Spring plenaries.  Chancellor Malatras stressed the need for additional funds from the state for various purposes.

SUNY hospitals and health science centers are “in crisis” because of covid-19. In addition to loss of staff with numerous vacancies that need to be filled, there has been significant loss of revenue due to cancellation of elective procedures during the pandemic.  Decreased staffing is a national problem, making it difficult to draw new staff from other states.  Malatras stated he advocated for “hazard pay” for hospital staff from the Governor (Cuomo) but was unsuccessful. (Overtime pay was granted.)  

A related problem is the shortage of nurses and competition for their services.  Competitive salaries, such as that of travel service nursing ($10,000 a week) also making it harder to attract nurses to work in the hospitals with current salaries.

The Chancellor knows we need more money for new physical spaces and state-of-the-art facilities on other campuses to keep SUNY on the cutting edge. 

He also wants more funding for mental health services and increased childcare on campuses, and financial aid for adult learners as well as for traditional-aged students.

SEE Approved Resolution (189-02-1) to influence development of Governor Hochul’s Executive Budget so that NYS becomes a “national leader in sustainably and equitably supporting and advancing SUNY and CUNY’s core academic missions.”







Some good news: 

20% increase in EOP funding (6.4 million dollars) in financial year 2022 budget, intended to support 1000 new EOP students   This money will be used for “persistence funds” (to help EOP students with emergencies that could interfere with their education), and also for new EOP students and EOP advisors at 5 community colleges (not all of which have EOP programs).



More good news:  Share Our Strength, a non-profit dedicated to ending child hunger, is donating $250,000 to go directly to reducing food insecurity among/providing food-related assistance to SUNY students, esp. those who have children.



Covid-19 Update 

On June 15, 2021, the Governor announced that all state-mandated Covid-19 health and safety restrictions were lifted; On June 24, 2021, NY state ended the state disaster emergency declared for the pandemic.

On July 7, 2021 (revised on July 8th), independent authority to manage most covid-19 protocols were returned to each campus.  System-wide requirement of weekly mandatory testing of any unvaccinated persons, student or employee, would continue. Campuses have the authority to impose more restrictive protocols.  With regard to contact tracing, local health departments are the now the designated points of contact.

The state has issued a mandatory indoor mask requirement at all state-operated facilities for everyone regardless of vaccination status.

All Management/Confidential employees at SUNY System Administration must be fully vaccinated against covid-19 as an on-going condition of employment.



Current status (as of 10/8/21) of SUNY community with regard to covid-19 vaccination and related procedures:

Approximately 98.8% of the entire SUNY student body is in compliance; 2.5% were granted an exemption.  These numbers are consistent with Old Westbury data (as of 10/28/21):  98% of students with on-campus presence have been vaccinated, and 2% have approved medical or religious exemptions.  99% of students residing on campus have been vaccinated.

System-wide, fewer than 3,200 students are non-compliant, the majority of whom are at less than 10 campuses, and are non-residential students at community colleges.

Vaccination rates for faculty, which has more variable, is ap. 90% system-wide.  (Note:  There may be some underreporting here, for a couple of reasons.  Those teaching remotely may not have submitted their vaccination info to their campus.  A second reason, given by a plenary past-president, is that even though he is vaccinated, he wants to get the weekly testing for covid-19, which is free and convenient on campus!

Vaccination rates among OW faculty and staff are also lower and more variable (as of 11/1/21):  



Re:  Fall 2021: 

Preliminary estimates indicate ap. 375,000 students enrolled in both in-person and online courses, with ap. 250,000 students having a physical presence on campus.

Campuses are reporting very low transmission rates, around .5% system-wide.

According to SUNY policy, all campuses must require that any student or employee who is not fully vaccinated must submit to mandatory weekly testing (or be subject to discipline, including suspension.)



Gen Ed Update and Takeaways 

The SUNY Board of Trustees will meet in November to consider the revised SUNY GE policy for approval.  If approved, draft guidance will be sent to campuses, and feedback from campuses will be collected and analyzed.  Final guidance is expected to be distributed to campuses some time in December. 

Based on feedback from campuses, implementation of the SUNY GE has been pushed back a year:  implementation will begin for students entering in Fall 2023.

Two things were emphasized at the plenary, by both UFS President Landa and Provost-in-Charge Sandvik: 



First, we were told multiple times to consider the new SUNY GE as a “foundational framework” – the minimal requirement.  “Campuses have the ability to add to this foundation in ways that specifically address their mission and community.” (Provost-in-Charge Sandvik’s Report.)

Second, it was equally stressed that the new Gen Ed should work in concert with seamless transfer.  Thus, any campus Gen Ed requirements should not – must not require more than 60 credits (for AA-, AS- and baccalaureate-degree programs).  

Campuses must go through their own local review and approval processes regarding course offerings and where they fit in the SUNY GE scheme. Consistency in expected learning outcomes across campuses is thus a critical component, and it is expected that all transfer campuses will accept all GE courses from students’ prior campus.  Seamless transfer must be seamless.



Despite the displeasure expressed by many over some of the proposed changes, the addition of Diversity: Equity, Inclusion, and Social Justice as a required area is most definitely a win.  Some discontent was expressed at the plenary over the inclusion of only three diversity dimensions (race, class, and gender). We were reminded that the new GE is a foundational framework, and that campuses could focus on additional diversity domains as they saw fit.

The foundational framework view does allow campuses wishing to provide students a more complete liberal arts foundation some flexibility to do so.  So, for example, if a campus Provost were in agreement with faculty that students should complete a more well-rounded set of courses, students could be required to complete that well-rounded set of courses – within SUNY guidelines –  as a graduation requirement. 

SUNY intends to take de-centralized approach to oversight of SUNY GE compliance.  System is leaving it up to individual campuses to carry out their Gen Ed program in accordance with the new model.  Ultimately, it is not just SUNY but also Middle States that must be satisfied with our Gen Ed program and compliance.

SUNY’s New Digital Learning Environment



Kim Scalzo, Interim Executive Director of Academic Technologies and Information Services, gave this presentation, which was largely an introduction to our new digital learning environment (DLE):  Brightspace’s Desire to Learn (D2L) platform.  She pointed out the advantages of the new DLE and outlined how the transition to D2L would proceed.

Currently, several platforms are used across the SUNY system:  

48 campuses use Blackboard (contract ends 12/31/22)

8 campuses use Moodle 

1 campus uses Canvas

1 campus Open LMS

2 campuses use Brightspace



This has resulted in different configurations for each campus, different data elements and data structures for each campus, and tools such as web conferencing, proctoring, accessibility compliance and video hosting varying by campus.  For students, this has meant changes in platform, course navigation, etc. from campus to campus.  This can be problematic, for example, when students transfer from campus to another, or when students on one campus are taking courses or engaging in other academic work on another campus.



The goal is to provide a unified digital learning environment across the SUNY system for students, faculty and administrators, with advantages such as:



a common, learning management system (LMS) application for students across campuses; 

enhanced accessibility to students, which would be in compliance with SUNY Board of Trustees Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility (EIT) Policy;

a common set of online tools integrated with the LMS;

common templates (that may be used across campuses); 

greater ability to fully utilize supports to faculty and students (such as SUNY Online and OER;

greater efficiency with seamless transfer and cross-registration;

greater information security from attacks/theft if all campuses are using the same system;

reduced overall licensing costs across the SUNY System along with the capacity to maintain or expand DLE;

greater efficiency in collecting critical data for strategic decisions; and

the capacity to leverage our size as a System when problems are addressed with vendor partners.



Campuses will have choice regarding when to migrate to D2L. The plenary presentation proposed three “cohorts” – with an 11-13 month transition period consisting of three phases for each cohort: planning and IT/Academic Prep (four months, for example, from January/February to April), training and pilot implementation with “early adopter” faculty (one full semester/summer sessions), and lastly, complete transition and “going live” with D2L use for all courses by all faculty (one full semester/fall semester).

SUNY will work with each campus with regard to training, which is intended to be free (i.e. no costs to individual campuses).  Trainings and support will be provided to faculty, students, ITS and helpdesk professionals, and System administrators. Training formats will include individual online and synchronous trainings, webinar series, trainings by campus-led teams, and student training modules.

Note to Blackboard users who do not want to switch:  Blackboard will be moving to a newer, “more modern interface” in the future that will not support current hosting options.  So, Blackboard users would have to learn/experience major changes as well. However, some campuses may choose to transition later than others (by 2023 or 2024 vs. full transition for Fall semester 2022).  Campuses that use Blackboard beyond the contractual period will require a “bridge contract” that covers the extended time for using Blackboard until they transition to D2L, and may have to pay a licensing fee to continue using Bb.

In order for SUNY to achieve all of the benefits of D2L, all campuses must make the switch to D2L.  Opting out is not an option.

Contact Kim Scalzo (kim.scalzo@suny.edu) if you have questions regarding the “DLE Project” overall.  Training questions may be addressed by Jamie Heron, SUNY Online Program Manager at the SUNY Center for Professional Development at (Jamie.heron@suny.edu).

RATIONALE:



WHEREAS the State University of New York (SUNY) and the City University of New York (CUNY), like other public higher education systems across the nation, in fulfilling their core academic missions, transform students’ lives and life chances and serve their state as foundations for democracy, platforms for civic engagement, engines of economic development, pathways to the middle class, magnets for population growth and private investment, and generators of health, creativity, and innovation1; and



WHEREAS SUNY and CUNY had not fully recovered from the Great Recession when the COVID-19 pandemic imposed new risks, costs, stresses, and responsibilities on their students, staff, faculty, and leaders, with especially heavy burdens on their frontline student- and patient-facing workers; and



WHEREAS significant Federal pandemic relief funds have been made available to SUNY and CUNY campuses, yet those funds provide only short-term offsets to drops in recurring State support; and



WHEREAS Governor Hochul and the New York State Legislature have a unique opportunity to make New York State a national leader in sustainably and equitably supporting and advancing SUNY and CUNY’s core academic missions; and



WHEREAS the SUNY University Faculty Senate (SUNY UFS) has worked closely in recent years with the SUNY Faculty Council of Community Colleges (SUNY FCCC) and the CUNY University Faculty Senate (CUNY UFS), and in alliance with the SUNY Student Assembly (SUNY SA), United University Professions (UUP), and the CUNY Professional Staff Congress (CUNY PSC) in advocating for New York State to become a national leader in investing direct state aid in SUNY and CUNY’s core operating budgets2

RESOLUTION:



THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the SUNY UFS urges Governor Hochul to craft an Executive Budget that makes New York State a national leader in sustainably and equitably supporting and advancing SUNY and CUNY’s core academic missions by



		significantly increasing the share of public funds going to public higher education core operating budgets and decreasing the share of SUNY and CUNY core operating costs paid for by student tuition and fees, through such means as

		fully funding all negotiated contractual increases;

		fully funding other mandatory operating cost increases for all SUNY and CUNY institutions, thereby augmenting New York State’s commitment to a robust maintenance of effort for SUNY and CUNY;

		restoring essential mission funding to SUNY hospitals, thereby recognizing their crucial contributions to the capacity and resilience of New York State’s medical and public health infrastructure;

		immediately and permanently pegging the maximum Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) award to SUNY tuition each year and sunsetting the SUNY/CUNY Supplemental TAP Awards, thereby both closing and ending the TAP Gap;

		pegging the maximum Excelsior Scholarship award to SUNY tuition and simplifying eligibility requirements;

		fully funding requests by the SUNY and CUNY Boards of Trustees for five-year capital plans addressing critical maintenance and new capital projects, as well as necessary accessibility upgrades to older buildings; and



FURTHER BE IT RESOLVED that the SUNY UFS calls on all SUNY campus governance bodies, along with all friends and all other good-faith partners of SUNY and CUNY, to speedily pass resolutions aligned with ours, and in those resolutions to encourage all students, alumni, donors, and current and former workers in or members of their body, in their capacity as citizens or residents of New York and/or supporters of public higher education, to urge Governor Hochul to make New York State a national leader in sustainably and equitably supporting and advancing SUNY and CUNY’s core academic missions.





BACKGROUND:



	According to a November 2018 Rockefeller Institute report, SUNY’s economic impact is $28.6 billion ($6.83 billion in Long Island, $4.37 billion in Western NY, $3.94 billion in Central NY,

$3.43 billion in the Capitol Region, $2.98 billion in the Southern Tier, $2.53 billion in New York City, $1.6 billion in the Hudson Valley, $1.32 billion in the Finger Lakes, $.82 billion in the Mohawk Valley, and $.78 billion in the North Country); every dollar invested in SUNY returns $8.17; and 78 percent of SUNY’s 633,000 bachelor’s degree graduates in 2006 worked in New York two years after graduation and 64 percent remained in the state eight years later.



According to higher education scholars Walter McMahon and Christopher Newfield,

decision-makers consistently underestimate higher education’s private non-market goods (on one’s health, longevity, happiness, human capital, working conditions, job type and benefits, control over consumption, savings, and family size, and children’s education and cognitive development), indirect private market benefits, nonmarket private benefits (both direct and indirect), and social goods (both direct and indirect), leading to an overemphasis on the “personal monetary benefit of a college degree,” although this is really “only about one-third” of its “overall value” (Newfield 71).



	See, for instance, the joint statement from the Executive Committees of SUNY UFS, SUNY FCCC, and CUNY UFS from January 2016, “Invest in CUNY and SUNY,” SUNY UFS’s January 2019 “New Deal for SUNY and CUNY” resolution, and SUNY UFS’s January 2020 “SUNY/CUNY Budget” resolution.



Policy-makers need to take a hard look at New York State’s ranking in standard measures of the fiscal health of public higher education, including



		SUNY’s and CUNY’s shares of NYS’s general fund;

		NYS general fund shares of SUNY’s and CUNY’s core operating budgets;

		appropriations of NYS general funds for operating expenses of SUNY and CUNY per

$1,000 of personal income in NY;

		appropriations of NYS general funds for operating expenses of SUNY and CUNY per capita in NY.



More general measures provide some insight into these matters.

What good reason can there be for New York State to be outside the top 20 in appropriations per $1,000 or the top 10 in appropriations per capita? Clearly, we have the capacity to be a true national leader; Governor Hochul is now in position to make us one.

**Based on data for SUNY campuses only, as reported by College Insight



Imagine a New York State in which instead of slowing the rates of increase of average student indebtedness and the share of indebted students in SUNY and CUNY, Governor Huchul were to lead a more ambitious effort to significantly reduce both.

	RE:	Resolution: Increase Flexibility in Telecommuting Policy and Work Plans

	Date:	189th Plenary, October 7-9, 2021

	Location:	Online

	Resolution #:	189-03-1

	Vote:	For: 27 / Against: 13 / Abstain: 2









RATIONALE:



WHEREAS the SUNY Workplace Flexibility-Telecommuting Work Plan1 developed during the pandemic, which was recently amended and extended, will expire on December 31, 2021; and



WHEREAS a stable faculty and staff is essential to delivering and maintaining a quality on-campus student educational experience; and



WHEREAS without the ability to work remotely, there will be a negative impact on morale, work-life balance, and the ability to retain and recruit diverse faculty and staff; and



WHEREAS other state-system schools have put forth dynamic and effective telecommuting policies2,3,4,5 that benefit employees and have demonstrated cost-savings; and



WHEREAS students will benefit from increased access to flexible instruction and campus resources and the example set by their educational experiences on SUNY campuses which may reflect the workplace of the future they encounter as alumni; and



WHEREAS in response to the New York State Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), SUNY has a stated mission and goals to move SUNY campuses towards a sustainable future6,7 and allowing flexibility for remote work plans is a potential space-saver; and



WHEREAS the current SUNY Workplace Flexibility-Telecommuting Work Plan creates burdensome and inflexible work requirements; and



WHEREAS the response to the COVID-19 pandemic was proof of concept that allowing flexibility for remote work can be optimized for enhancing instructional delivery using advances in educational technology;







RESOLUTION

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the SUNY University Faculty Senate supports the Chancellor’s and the unions’ efforts thus far and urges them to continue to work with the Governor’s Office of Employee Relations to



		develop a more flexible policy designed with stakeholder input;

		focus on flexibility leading to productivity rather than formalized strictures for telecommuting policy;

		extend the SUNY Workplace Flexibility-Telecommuting Work Plan beyond December 31, 2021; and

		pursue a permanent policy.

	RE:	Resolution on Contact Hours Policy for Applied Learning Experiences

	Date:	189th Plenary, October 7-9, 2021

	Location:	Online

	Resolution #:	189-04-1

	Vote:	For: 38 / Against: 1 / Abstain: 3





RATIONALE:



WHEREAS since 2015 the SUNY Board of Trustees has emphasized the importance of applied learning in the undergraduate educational program; and



WHEREAS the most recent Memorandum to Presidents from the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Programs regarding the relationship of credit to contact hours for experiential learning is dated June 30, 1976; and



WHEREAS the 1976 SUNY Memorandum is outdated and does not reflect the actual credit/contact hour practices throughout SUNY, including the requirement for the student to satisfy clearly stated learning outcomes of college level learning; and



WHEREAS the 1976 SUNY Memorandum specifies that “When life or work experience is to be credited as a concurrent portion of an academic program design, as in an internship, one semester credit hour will be awarded for each 40-45 clock-hour week of supervised academic activity that provides the learning considered necessary to program study”; and



WHEREAS the definitions in New York State, Title 8, Chapter II §50.1(n) and (o) of the Regulations of the Commissioner indicate the minimum time requirements for awarding credit:



(n) “Credit means a unit of academic award applicable towards a degree offered by the institution.” (o) “Semester hour means a credit, point, or other unit granted for the satisfactory completion of a course which requires at least 15 hours (of 50 minutes each) of instruction and at least 30 hours of supplementary assignments, except as otherwise provided pursuant to section 52.2(c)(4) of this Subchapter. This basic measure shall be adjusted proportionately to translate the value of other academic calendars and formats of study in relation to the credit granted for study during the two semesters that comprise an academic year”;



WHEREAS questions and discrepancies have arisen on SUNY campuses regarding the appropriate number of credits to award for applied learning experiences when clock hours worked do not align with the time necessary to achieve stated learning outcomes;



RESOLUTION:



THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the University Faculty Senate recommends to the Chancellor that the SUNY Policy on the award of credit for Experiential Learning be amended to make it congruent with the current Commissioner’s and Federal Regulations and state, “When life or work experience is to be credited as a concurrent portion of an academic program design, as in an internship, one semester credit hour will be awarded for a minimum of 40 clock-hours of supervised academic activity that provides the learning considered necessary to program study.”

FURTHER BE IT RESOLVED that the SUNY UFS calls on SUNY campus governance bodies to individually endorse the AAUP Joint Statement; and



FURTHER BE IT RESOLVED that the SUNY UFS calls on its President, Officers, Executive Committee, campus governance leaders (CGLs), and Senators to use their positions as higher education leaders to educate their communities on the dangers of such described legislation and the importance of racial equity and academic freedom.
