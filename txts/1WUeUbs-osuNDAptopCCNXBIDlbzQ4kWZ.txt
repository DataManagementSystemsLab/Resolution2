Motion on Reappointment Case of Dr. Jane Weiss (Revised)
Whereas,

The nonreappointment of Dr. Jane Weiss despite unanimous support in the former English
Language Studies Department for a one-year or two-year reappointment, and unanimous support in
the Appointment, Reappointment, Promotion and Tenure Committee for a two-year reappointment,
violates faculty judgment and the “primary responsibility” of faculty for hiring, evaluating,
retaining and promoting its own members, as recognized by the Association of American
University Professors (AAUP), American Council on Education (ACE), and Association of
Governing Boards of University and Colleges (AGB) Joint Statement on the Government of
Colleges and Universities, as amended (1990),
And whereas,

Overturning recommendations reached through designated departmental and ARPT review
processes and substituting determinations entirely outside the range of those considered during the
designated review process undermines the trust that makes shared governance possible and creates
an uncertain environment for junior faculty,
And whereas,

A violation of justice has occurred in that Dr. Weiss was at no time warned of possible dismissal or
provided with a procedure for improving performance to avoid dismissal, prior to her actual
notification of nonreappointment,
And whereas,
The AAUP-ACE-ABG

Joint Statement on the Government of Colleges and Universities, referenced

above, declares that in matters of faculty status “the power of review or final decision lodged in the
governing board or delegated by it to the president should be exercised adversely only in
exceptional circumstances,”

And whereas,

The AVP’s memorandum and letter recommending nonreappointment, dated Aug. 2 and 11, 2004,
and President Butts’s notification of nonreappointment to Dr. Weiss, dated Aug. 31, 2004, make no
reference to exceptional circumstances,
Therefore, be it resolved,

The Senate respectfully urges President Butts to reverse his nonreappointment decision and to
retain Dr. Weiss for an additional reappointment of at least one year,
And,

The Senate respectfully requests President Butts to address the Senate in a timely manner giving his
response to this Resolution.
