for Merit Awards

on

October 30, 2002, to President Butts’ Office.

A Committee of four (Kimmins, Davis, Welton, Lind) made final recommendations to
Dr. Butts.

Equity recommendations for faculty were also determined by this Committee
(Kimmins, Davis, Welton, Lind) based on a disparity analysis of all faculty salaries
using multiple-regression.
Dr. Butts makes all final decisions based on the recommendations for both merit and
equity. In order to qualify for an equity award — faculty must have earned a merit
award, ie. there is no equity award without merit.
Dr. Butts has agreed that fixed dollar amounts will be awarded for both equity and
merit awards for faculty. This differs from the percentage based award system used
last year.
