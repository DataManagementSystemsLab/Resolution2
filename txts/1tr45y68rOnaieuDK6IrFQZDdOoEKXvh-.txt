ARPT consists of seven elected or appointed members from the faculty. Elections at the end of Spring 2020 left
two SAS (tenured) seats unfilled. The Faculty Senate chair approved moving an elected At-Large member to fill
one of these. A second SAS seat and an open At-Large seat were filled by appointments of runners-up. Jeanne
Shimizu and Jill Crocker were elected as co-Chairs at the first meeting of the fall 2020 semester. In Spring 2021 a
one-semester vacancy for the SOE seat was filled by appointment, and Jill Crocker was reaffirmed as Chair.
II. Activities
A. File Review
ARPT heard and voted on 31 cases in AY2020-2021, 30 of which resulted in full agreement between the
Department majority, ARPT, and the final administrative decision. There were no disagreements regarding terms
of reappointments, or on the question of retention. The attached report from Academic Affairs provides
additional information.
B. Transition to Electronic Review Process
Following COVID-related adaptations made in Spring 2020, in Fall 2020 the College transitioned to an electronic
RPT review process. This transition included a move to a virtual presentation format via Zoom and a file review
process via Interfolio, which had been selected by a joint task force with representatives from the full range of
stakeholders during summer 2020. Effective Spring 2021, all stages of Reappointment, Promotion, and Tenure
reviews – including Evaluation Committee and Department Review – are now conducted electronically using
Interfolio. The system protects candidate confidentiality, and was set up to follow the ARPT Manual and to support
existing RPT procedures.
In addition to continued collaborations to support faculty navigating RPT processes (UUP “Getting to Tenure…and
Beyond” Workshop; Academic Affairs New Faculty Orientation), ARPT facilitated three Interfolio workshops in fall
2020 and developed a number of resources (e.g. video tutorials, overview/FAQ documents) to support faculty in
their use of the electronic system. These resources are linked throughout Interfolio, and are publicly available via
the Faculty Senate webpage, listed below the ARPT Manual:

The committee is grateful to the faculty for your patience, feedback, and questions as we have worked to develop,
refine, and adapt to the new system. We also thank Academic Affairs for their collaboration and support in this
transition. Having now completed three semesters (and 41 cases) using Interfolio, and confident that the existing
system supports and adheres to the procedural guidelines outlined in the ARPT Manual and approved by the
faculty, we look forward to transitioning the primary responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the Interfolio
system to Interfolio Administrator, Barbara Hillery.
C. Procedural Decisions of Note
1. SUNY-UUP MOU
ARPT has addressed the SUNY-UUP Negotiated MOU regarding tenure clock extensions by requesting that
Department Evaluations of candidates covered by the MOU and who are up for OYTTRR/TYTTRR specify:
a. Whether (or not) the candidate currently intends to opt-out of the tenure clock extensions, if known.
b. Whether the department voted on a one- or two-year reappointment, or both.
These statements are not binding, and the choice to opt out of the tenure clock extension remains with the
candidate, but it is helpful to ARPT to understand how the candidate/department proceeded with the review in
light of the MOU.
These specifications do not substitute for formal notification following the instructions provided by Human
Resources. No such specifications are requested for candidates up for reviews other than the OYTTRR/TYTTRR,
which is typically the third review.
Having observed confusion on the matter, ARPT encourages Academic Affairs and/or Human Resources to
regularly communicate clear and consistent information regarding the allowances of the MOU and the
process/timeline by which eligible faculty may opt-out if they choose.
2. Department Procedures
Because the Interfolio system has been set up to follow requirements of the ARPT Manual, the workflow requires
that all materials from the Department Review process (including Minority Reports and Candidate Responses, if
any) must be uploaded to the file prior to ARPT Deposit. The committee voted unanimously (6-0-0; 6 in favor, 0
opposing, 0 abstaining) to affirm that any past exceptions to this ARPT procedure as outlined in the Manual will not
be treated as precedent.
3. Promotion to Professor
Following review and discussion of the language in the ARPT Manual, the committee voted unanimously that
promotion from Assistant Professor directly to the rank of Professor is not procedurally allowable (0-6-0; 0 in favor,
6 opposing, 0 abstaining). The committee further takes the position that such a practice, if allowed by a future
revision of the Manual, would put the College outside of the norms of academia.
