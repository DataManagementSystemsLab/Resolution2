 Resolutionâ€”Combined B.S. in Mathematics/M.A.T. in Mathematics/ Adolescence
                                  Education

WHEREAS,    The School of Education and Mathematics  Department  have  found
          significant student interest in a 5 year program that will  result
          in a combined Bachelor of Science in  Mathematics  and  Master  of
          Arts in Teaching  Mathematics/ Adolescence Education, and

WHEREAS,    The proposed  5  year  program  revises  two  existing  programs
          (Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Master of Arts in Teaching
          Mathematics/ Adolescence  Education)  into  one  5  year  combined
          program, and

WHEREAS,    The proposed  5  year  combined  B.S./M.A.T  will  allow  highly
          qualified students to complete both a Bachelor of  Science  degree
          in Mathematics and a  Master  of  Arts  in  Teaching  Mathematics/
          Adolescence  Education  degree  in   5   years   by   accelerating
          undergraduate coursework and taking graduate courses in their  4th
          year of study, and

WHEREAS,    The proposed 5 year program consists entirely  of  courses  that
          are already offered in the School of Education curriculum and  the
          curriculum of other departments involved  in  this  program,  thus
          mitigating the need for any additional resources, and

WHEREAS,    The proposed 5 year program allows students to fulfill  the  New
          York State requirement of obtaining a Masters degree in  order  to
          qualify for their teaching certification, and

WHEREAS,    The School  of  Education  has  determined  that  students  with
          Masters degrees have a higher  passing  rate  on  New  York  State
          teaching certification examinations.


THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED

      That the Senate approves the proposed Combined Bachelor of Science  in
          Mathematics/ Master of Arts in Teaching  Mathematics  /Adolescence
          Education program.

                     Approved by CAP for submission to Senate, March 6, 2015
