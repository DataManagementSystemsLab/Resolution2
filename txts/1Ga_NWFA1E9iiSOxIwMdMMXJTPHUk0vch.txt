All minors require a minimum of five courses and 20 credits. A minimum of 16 credits in the minor cannot be courses taken to fulfill studentâ€™s major requirements.  For a PEL major this means they will have to take a minimum of an additional 4 courses that are not being used as part of their major requirements. Up to two courses in a minor may be transferred from another institution. Completion of a minor requires a 2.0 cumulative grade point average in courses applied to the minor. No D grades may be applied toward a minor.
