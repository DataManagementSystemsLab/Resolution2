Resolution for Annual Shared Governance Orientation
Whereas, meaningful participation in a system of shared governance requires an understanding of the structure and
purpose of that system, and
Whereas, the issues facing faculty are often recurrent, and arise in contexts that are important and useful to
understand, and
Whereas, the accountability of Senators and of the Executive Committee to the full faculty depends on a clear and
common understanding of their roles, and
Whereas, each year the Faculty Senate Executive Committee seeks to recruit and engage representatives to the Faculty
Senate (i.e. Senators) who may be new or returning, and
Whereas, many voting members of the Faculty Senate, new and returning, may benefit from a clear statement of the
purposes, functions, and rules of the Senate, and
Whereas, many voting members of the Faculty Senate, new and returning, are likely to be only marginally familiar with
parliamentary procedure,

Be it therefore Resolved, that prior to the first working meeting of the Faculty Senate each academic year, the Faculty
Senate Executive Committee or its designees will coordinate a training and information session that is open to the
campus community and that:
‐
‐
‐
‐
‐
‐
‐

Briefly reviews the concept, purpose, and structure of shared governance at Old Westbury;
Introduces the types and charges of committees on which faculty serve;
Advises participants on where additional information about Faculty Senate history, terminology,
and Bylaws can be located;
Explains the roles of Senators and Senate leadership (i.e. the Executive Committee);
Reviews the major issues addressed by or still pending before the Faculty Senate from the preceding
academic year(s);
Highlights anticipated issues facing the faculty this year, and briefly reviews the context of each;
Introduces participants to the rules of order followed by the Faculty Senate.

Be it further Resolved, that this orientation shall occur at a time and date likely to maximize faculty participation (e.g. a
regular Faculty Senate meeting‐time at the start of the semester).
Be it further Resolved, that the first occurrence of this orientation will take place at the soonest possible meeting
following the approval of this Resolution by the Faculty Senate.
Be it further Resolved, that the organization of this orientation shall be the responsibility of the Executive Committee.
Be it further Resolved, that this orientation shall draw on the experience and expertise of a range of community
members, and may include as presenters/facilitators individuals not currently serving as part of the Executive
Committee, in the Senate, or as members of the Faculty, at the discretion of the Senate Chair.
Be it further Resolved, that this orientation will be in addition to, rather than a replacement for, the annual Faculty
Rights and Responsibilities Committee presentation of the Bylaws to the Faculty Senate.
Be it further Resolved, that the effectiveness of each orientation shall be assessed by the Executive Committee or its
designees in order to enable substantive improvements from year to year, and to ensure the orientations’
continuing relevance and utility to the faculty.
