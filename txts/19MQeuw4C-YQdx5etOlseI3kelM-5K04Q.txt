Resolution: Revised Manual for Appointment, Reappointment,
Promotion and Tenure
Whereas,

The present ARPT Manual dates from 2003, and many College, Department, and
ARPT practices and norms have changed in the interim, and

Whereas,

The Senate in 2018 commissioned a revision of the Manual to reflect current
practices, and

Whereas,

This revision was produced during summer 2018 and was vetted and modified in
fall-spring 2018-2019 by a committee of six faculty with long ARPT experience
drawn from the Schools of Business (1), Education (1), and Arts and Sciences (4),
as well as UUP (1 of the six members), and

Whereas,

This modified document, with further changes by the current ARPT Committee,
is now recommended by ARPT to the Senate for consideration and adoption, and

Whereas,

The draft Manual as revised reflects current Board of Trustees, UUP, College, and
ARPT norms and practices in a clean and usable format, subject to future
modification as may later be needed,

Therefore, be it resolved,
That the 2019 draft “Manual for Appointment, Reappointment, Promotion, and
Tenure” (Manual) is accepted by the Faculty Senate, and
Be it further resolved,
That the revised Manual shall apply to all ARPT cases starting with the first full
semester after its adoption, except as further specified, and
Be it further resolved,
That candidates already in the process leading to tenure consideration (“on the
tenure track”) prior to that semester may choose to follow either the 2003 or
the revised Manual and may adopt the latter at any time up to and including
their consideration for tenure and promotion to Associate Professor.
