undergraduate program. The Strategic Plan includes 5 lines for the graduate program.
There was an extended discussion about the role of teaching / research assistants in graduate
programs. The proposal calls for “‘a small number of graduate assistants ... to aid faculty in
research and teaching activities,” and the intention is that they be funded from external
funds. Several Senators expressed the view that the role of graduate students should be
specified, as this is a precedent-setting issue. A majority of Senators wished to consider
graduate student issues separately from approval of the Masters program.

The following motion was approved unanimously [18-0-0]: The Senate concurs with CAP in
approving the proposal for the MS in Accounting. However, graduate assistants are not
approved until policy regarding their use is approved by Senate.
Report on the Faculty Fund (J. Lloyd)
J. Lloyd presented the Treasurer’s Report for the 2000/2001 academic year (attached). The
balance in September 2001 was $233 less than it was at the same time last year. Faculty were
urged to contribute to the Fund, which is used to support faculty in times of bereavement and
illness. A second request will be circulated.
The meeting was adjourned at 1:40 PM.
