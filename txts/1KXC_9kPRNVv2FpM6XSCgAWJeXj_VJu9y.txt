With Respect to the Implementation of the April 2016 GEC Resolution on LEAP “Essential Learning Outcomes”
Whereas, on April 22, 2016, the Faculty Senate passed the GEC Resolution on LEAP “Essential Learning
Outcomes,”1 which was co-sponsored by the General Education and CAP Committees, and
Whereas, the GEC Resolution on LEAP “Essential Learning Outcomes” adopted the AAC&U’s LEAP (Liberal
Education and America’s Promise) “essential learning outcomes” 2 as the model for creating the College’s
institutional learning outcomes, and
Whereas, the whitepaper, “SUNY General Education for the 21 st Century”3 (referenced in the UFS report at the
11/2/18 Faculty Senate meeting, , and to which the College responded, on 11/16/184) describes ways in which
the University Faculty Senate and SUNY are striving to bring SUNY requirements into alignment with and
Middle States expectations and the LEAP standards that the Old Westbury Faculty have adopted, and
Whereas, the GEC Resolution on LEAP “Essential Learning Outcomes” called for the creation of a joint facultyadministration group to coordinate the “mapping” of our curriculum onto the LEAP learning outcomes, and
Whereas, the successful articulation of institutional learning outcomes is essential to the College’s ability to
meet the expectations for Middle States accreditation under the new standards,5 and
Whereas, in order to meet Middle States expectations, the College’s academic assessment plan must include
the regular assessment of academic learning outcomes at the General Education, Program, and college-wide
level, and
Whereas, the responsibility for academic assessment is shared between Academic Affairs and the Faculty, and
Whereas, more than two and a half years have elapsed since the Senate approved the GEC Resolution on LEAP
“Essential Learning Outcomes,” and
Whereas, the College has already begun its Middle States self-study process, in anticipation of the Middle
States Team visit in 2021, Therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Faculty Senate and Academic Affairs shall establish a joint faculty-administrative body
(hereafter, “Institutional Learning Outcomes Joint Task Force,” or ILOJTF) to achieve the goal of “mapping” the
College’s curriculum on to the LEAP institutional outcomes, and further
Resolved, that the ILOJTF be constituted immediately, with membership to include:
• The Chair of the Liberal Education Committee,
• The Chair of the Curriculum and Academic Planning Committee,
• The Faculty Senate Chair (or designee),
• Two at-large members of the Faculty representing different disciplines,
• The Director of Academic Assessment,
• The Asst. VP of Academic Affairs for Institutional Research and Assessment; and further

Resolved, that the ILOJTF be charged to
• Identify the extent to which each of the LEAP learning outcomes is already encompassed by existing
Liberal Education learning outcomes, to the extent that they are, and to “map” those correlations;
• Identify any LEAP learning outcomes that are not already encompassed by existing Liberal Education
learning outcomes;
• Propose to the Faculty specific changes to the College’s institutional learning outcomes, in alignment
with LEAP;
• Propose appropriate adjustment(s) to the membership of the Liberal Education Committee to
accommodate the proposed institutional learning outcomes, per the 2016 Faculty Bylaws, Article VII,
§F, para. 2, subsec. a); and further,
Resolved, that the Learning Outcomes Joint Task Force complete its work by the end of March 2019, to allow
adequate time for
• Senate deliberation on its recommendation and
• the implementation of any required changed to the College’s academic assessment plans or
• to the membership of the Liberal Education Committee, and
• that the College will have a reasonable hope of completing one round of academic assessment under
the LEAP model, and
• in light of Middle States expectations and deadlines.
