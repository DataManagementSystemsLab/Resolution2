Dear President Sams,

On December 10th 2021 the Faculty Senate passed the attached resolution
without dissent.  The resolution calls for immediate action by the
College’s administration to advocate on behalf of SUNY Old Westbury to the
SUNY Chancellor, SUNY Board of Trustees, and New York State Legislature and
Governor’s Office for critically needed capital funds for the science
building renovation and expansion in anticipation of future growth
projections.  The resolution strongly urges a single-phase renovation plan,
and for the College’s administration to prioritize a thoughtful approach
that supports the mission of the College including development of surge
space that is least disruptive to teaching and research activities on
campus.  The Faculty Senate urges the projects be considered a top priority
in capital planning and budgeting in the upcoming 2022/2023 Capital Budget
Request to be submitted to the Board of Trustees.

Please find attached the full resolution below.  The Faculty appreciate
your continued support and advocacy on behalf of our College, most
especially in support of our students.

Sincerely,



Jennie D’Ambroise
Faculty Senate Chair
