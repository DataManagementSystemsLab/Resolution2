Resolution:
The recent anonymous letters being circulated on the past history of Vice President
Lawrence Cox are both reprehensible and irresponsible. If any faculty member or
members have a legitimate complaint against Dr. Cox, they should take it to the
grievance committee of faculty governance. Details of Dr. Cox’s biography are only
relevant in a search committee’s evaluation. It is telling that these accusations for the
most part sound trivial and petty. Anonymous accusations don’t diminish the reputation
of Dr. Cox but do damage the perception of the faculty at Old Westbury and should stop
immediately.
