sees them as having a fundamental

University, has a simple way of weighing

a

career move: "I ask myself, would I rather be
in meetings or would I rather be in the
classroom? Teaching is really the best part of

my job."

Many faculty members share Allitt’s love for the classroom, according to a new national
survey about faculty job satisfaction. Nearly 1,000 professors across the country
responded to questions that asked what they liked best and least about their work and
how respected they felt by students, administrators, and people in the community. The
survey, commissioned by The Chronicle with support from TIAA, was conducted in July
and August by Maguire Associates.

The Best and Worst Part of Being a Professor: Students - The Chronicle of Higher Education

Teaching was the aspect of the job that the largest share of professors found satisfying,

with 91 percent feeling "somewhat" or "very" satisfied" with that work. Mentoring
students or junior faulty members was a close second, at 87 percent.

Many expressed pleasure at having the opportunity to help shape the minds of the next
generation. Professors wrote about the joys of helping students discover an "aha!"

moment, feeling that they can make a positive difference in students’ lives, and preparing
students for life beyond the classroom.
At the same time, the survey shows, students are one of the clearest sources of stress.

Among the frustrations of being a professor, respondents said were students’ being
unprepared for college, unwilling to read required texts, and unmotivated to participate
in class.
Nearly two-thirds of the faculty members agreed with a statement that students are
harder to teach than students of years past. Respondents overwhelmingly said they
believed that student engagement had gotten worse, with only about one in five agreeing
with a statement that today’s students are more engaged than were students of years

past.

Such sentiments, however, don’t appear to chip away at faculty members’ passion for
their jobs in general. At a time when public skepticism about higher education is running

high, those who were surveyed still believe that their jobs gain them a fair amount of
respect — from students, from the community, and from family and friends. More than
half, 54 percent, said that if they were beginning their careers anew, they would still

definitely choose to work in higher education.
A career as an academic often spans a lifetime, and 45 percent of respondents said they
expected to stay in their line of work that long, with a larger share of professors at public
colleges than at private colleges holding that hope. Faculty members are on the fence,
however, about encouraging their own children or family members to follow in their
footsteps. Only one out of five said they "definitely would"; about one out of four said

they either "probably would" or were "unsure."
