SUNY
College at Old Westbury
Student Government Association
SGA Resolution on Mission II Review

Whereas, The Mission Review II document is the guidance document for the college for

the next five years, and

Whereas, The document sets the benchmarks for the college which effects future funding,
and
Whereas, The document reflects the needs of the school and should be reflective of the

needs and concerns of the students and faculty, and

Whereas, faculty involvement was not a critical part of the document planning process
until after the first, self-imposed 11/15 deadline, and

Whereas, The content of the document calls for an expanded bureaucracy and increased

enrollment, but vaguely mentions critical facilities needs, and

Whereas, The Academic Village is the collegeâ€™s oldest and most utilized building on
campus and is not ADA compliant in a number of areas including elevators, doorways,
and bathrooms and is not specifically targeted in the Mission II Review document for
specific repairs needed as prescribed by the Campus Capital Plan but lumped together in
vague references with other campus buildings, and
Whereas, The Mission II Review Document is calling for the school to expand

enrollment and graduate programs without a correlative allocation for the expansion of
faculty in order to assure a continued low student to faculty ratio, and

Whereas, There is a critical need for dormitory space for Old Westbury students, but the

document does not call for funds to be allocated to the renovation of old Academic
Village dorms which are being utilized by Old Westbury and non-Old Westbury students,
Now, therefore be it

Resolved That the Faculty Senate of the SUNY College at Old Westbury votes no
confidence on the Mission II Review document, and be it further

Resolved that the Senate urge the administration to address existing on campus problems
and college body concerns before it commits itself future college expansion.
