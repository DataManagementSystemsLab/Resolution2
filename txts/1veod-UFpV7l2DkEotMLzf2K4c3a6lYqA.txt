What to Look for in the Draft Revised ARPT Manual





In reading, bear the following in mind:

		The document is intended to be more specific and user-friendly throughout

		The important changes are in Parts I-III (Criteria, Preparation of Files, ARPT Authority and Procedures)

		Most changes from the 2003 Manual are flagged by footnotes that start "EXPLANATION" and describe the change. These notes will be removed when the document is finalized. Readers can scan through the document looking for these notes to get an idea of changes from the present (2003) Manual

		The Criteria (Part I) are mainly unchanged, but specification has been added in several areas:

			Evaluation Periods have been defined

			Matters like what constitutes service have been specified and clarified

			Definition of candidates’ rights has been consolidated in one place and expanded

			There has been some clarification on what constitutes "growth" and on selecting persons to supply external evaluations in tenure and promotion cases.

		The Preparation of Files section (Part II) is mostly the same in substance but the descriptions of department evaluation and self-evaluation documents have been thoroughly rewritten.

		The Board of Trustees Criteria (start of Part I) can’t be amended. The Bylaws description of ARPT (Part III) also can't be amended except in a later Bylaws revision, but the latter has an added section on modifications ARPT has adopted in practice.
