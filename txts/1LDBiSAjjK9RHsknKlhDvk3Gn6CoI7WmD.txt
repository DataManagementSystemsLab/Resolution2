Teaching and Learning Resources Committee (TLRC)
Annual Report 2018-2019
Submitted by Jill Crocker
I. Membership
The TLRC consists of seven elected/appointed faculty members and, as of 2019, four ex-officio members. At the last
meeting of 2018-19 (May 2019) the committee voted unanimously to officially add two ex officio non-voting seats
to the committee: an Instructional Designer (currently Chandra Shehigian) and the Coordinator of the Center for
Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL; currently Cris Notaro). These additions reflect current practice and
facilitate and formalize communication and collaboration across units in fulfillment of the committee’s charge.

II. Activities
The TLRC continues to work to provide teaching development opportunities and resources, create spaces that
foster faculty connections, and address teaching-related issues as they arise.
During the 2018-2019 academic year, the TLRC hosted a fall New Faculty Orientation focused on teaching-issues for
26 new full-time faculty, a half-day spring conference themed “Little Things, Big Impact,” and five roundtable
discussions. In addition, we collaborated with CETL and Student Affairs to host a half-day workshop on Implicit Bias,
and a follow-up strategy roundtable discussion. We co-sponsored UUP’s annual “Getting to Tenure and Beyond”
workshop, and continued to maintain a TLRC LibGuide with a variety of teaching-related resources (e.g. event
flyers, links to GenEd Learning Objectives, the final exam schedule, etc.). In addition to these activities (also listed
below), the TLRC held a total of eight business meetings (4 per semester), along with regular online discussions.
The committee continued to serve in an advisory capacity to the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning
(CETL) in its first full year of activity.
Please note that members of the TLRC rely heavily on the expertise and participation of our colleagues to develop
successful initiatives, and always welcome suggestions/volunteers for presenters.
