Program Revision Proposal:

                            Creating New Program(s) from Existing Program(s)
                                                                  EPP Form N

This form should be used to seek SUNY’s approval to create one or more new
programs from existing, registered programs.  A campus is not required to
submit a Program Announcement (PA) or a Letter of Intent (LI) for these
types of new programs.   The Chief Executive or Chief Academic Officer
should submit a signed cover letter and this completed form to the SUNY
Provost at program.review@suny.edu.

[  X ]      This proposal is for a multi-award program  that  leads  to  two
      separate awards  (e.g.,  A.S./B.A.,  B.S./M.S.).   Complete  Part  2A,
      below.    NOTE:  Such programs generally  involve  special  admissions
      for students who have the capacity to complete all awards,  curricular
      integration between the component  programs,  and  shortened  time  to
      degree compared to taking the programs separately.

 [    ]     This proposal is for a multi-institution program (also called  a
      “jointly registered program”) to be offered jointly  by  two  or  more
      institutions.  Complete Part B, below.   NOTE:  Such programs  involve
      a formal agreement between two or more institutions to  offer  courses
      leading to an award.

   they related to student success?


   Admission Requirements:
      • Mathematics majors who have completed a minimum of 60 credits
        (including 24 at Old Westbury) may begin the formal application
        into the Combined B.S. / M.A.T. program.
      • Candidates must have taken at least five courses (20 credits),
        including 3 courses (12 credits) at Old Westbury, that are required
        for BS in mathematics degree.
      • Candidates must have a cumulative GPA of 3.25 overall and 3.25 in
        all the courses required for the B.S. in Mathematics degree.
      • Transfer students follow the same admission requirement. They must
        take at least 6 courses (24 credits), including 3 courses (12
        credits) required for BS in Mathematics.
      • Other requirements:
    ▪ An interview is required
    ▪ An essay
    ▪ GRE scores
    ▪ Two letters of reference from faculty
    ▪ All college transcripts
      • Admission to the program is made by the department of mathematics &
        SOE graduate admission committee.

   Program Info & Requirements
      • Highly qualified candidates will complete the program in five years
        by accelerating undergraduate coursework, and moving on to graduate
        study in the fourth year.
      • Candidates must maintain a GPA of 3.25 (overall and in the major)
        in each semester of study.  Additionally, no grades of D are
        permitted for any required courses, and candidates must meet
        requirements of the Mathematics major (a grade of C or better in
        all Math and CIS courses).
      • Candidates whose GPA falls below 3.25 will be placed on probation
        and will have one semester to bring up their grades.  Candidates
        who fail to complete the five-year program will be administratively
        transferred into the Mathematics major, and will graduate with the
        B.S. degree.
      • Transfer students must complete a minimum of 28 credits (7 courses)
        of the required mathematics courses for BS in mathematics and 12
        credits (4 courses) of the required mathematics courses for MAT in
        mathematics at Old Westbury.

|For programs leading to initial certification, list all pedagogical courses in the|
|proposed program in the Pedagogical Core Courses table below.   The Pedagogical   |
|Core Courses Table is designed for a program leading to a single certificate or   |
|multiple certificates. See example on Pedagogical Core Courses Table for an       |
|inclusive childhood education program leading to Childhood Education 1-6 (Cert    |
|Code: 02) and Teaching Students with Disabilities 1-6 (Cert Code: 06).            |

|In the first four columns, identify each pedagogical course by course number,     |
|title, number of credits, required (R) or elective (E), and the                   |
|instructor(s)/status (full-time or part-time). See example on Pedagogical Core    |

|Use the Certification Area Codes listed immediately below to identify the         |
|certificate area(s) the program leads to and insert the certificate area number   |

|for certification in Childhood Education 1-6 and Teaching Students with           |
|Disabilities Childhood 1-6, mark 02 and 06 in the Cert Code columns. See example  |
