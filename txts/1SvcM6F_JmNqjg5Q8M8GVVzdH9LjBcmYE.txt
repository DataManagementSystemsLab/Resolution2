Institutional report – indicates the standards that we need to reply to – 3,4, and 5

 This is due in March

Document included will help get everyone on the same page about the timeline

Academic departments need to do particular assessments

Some departments having fruitful discussions about how assessments can help improve practices

Closing the loop activities – how does data help inform our changing practices

Presidential Committees

Discussion about whether faculty representation on committees is as a admin representative or as a representative from the faculty

Again clarified that discussions about representation can continue via email   

President’s Report

Talking about two topics: governance and Hanover consulting group, and updates

Residential college: organizing student experience – there are two large ways

How managed at a large university and how is it managed at a small college

Want ‘closer’ education for our students in the liberal arts tradition 

Residential colleges create cohorts and smaller groups that can develop closer relationships 

Enable deeper intellectual development and broaden students’ horizons

Older model: Many of the original residential universities break down into smaller colleges, where faculty serve as deans or house leaders  - and students remain within that ‘college’  	

Newer: living learning communities (LLCs) or themed housing experience or mixed 

Smaller college: want to stay small so students get deeper and broader educational experience

Can OW be hybrid? Close educational experience? We can perhaps create new opportunities that may not exist 

Give students best experience possible through best of both worlds 

Residential college – mostly focus on undergrads, particularly first year experience – new skills 

Residential model could help make our already great FYE to 

Sophomore jump – allows students to think about who they are 	

Could be organized around disciplines: STEM, criminal justice, performing arts (help students get ‘deeper’ experience), not just ideas but corresponding behaviors

Thematic – sustainability, international ideas, social justice, honors, 

Capstone projects – shaped by residential experience – internships and externships, “tinkering”, practicums, labs, faculty mentorships 

What about commuters? 

These could also be organized around cohorts – also thematic or academic or interests 

Activities could still be college-wide 

So, cohorts aren’t just for the residents 

They are at intersection of Co-Academic life – developmental growth and academic growth 

This closeness would help bridge this gap that non-residential life sometimes creates 

Questions/response:

Martha Livingston: 

faculty have the ability to determine their own curriculum, so she’s curious how the residential model would affect/influence this.

Also, curious about residential model and how this will affect the commuter community (LI and city residents)

What is the rationale for this? If we don’t have money – cancel sections, but we have lots more money for these big projects – wonder about the priorities 

Response: 

model doesn’t affect faculty curriculum development – expands platform and expands co-curricular opportunities, if Student Affairs are looking at student outcomes, it helps when they partner with co-curricular activities – excites students and engages them

Commuters: this residential name is less important and more important that we see cohort formation, not just for those living on campus, and it can be part of student identity as well. This helps define as well.

Resources: yes, we need to go get more resources, and wondering how to re-prioritize resources to make things possible 

Margaret Torrell

What ratio of students? How long for transition? Will it affect existing majors? 

Response: 

Ideal ratio: economic question and our ability to support student success. looking at cost of attendance model – what is the financial component 

Transition: it could take a while. Performance planning pathway – depends on the faculty ideas, and other ideas that feed into this

Curriculum: this has to do with faculty – never seen (in 4 or 5 colleges) that residential college reduce attendance in 

Amplifies spaces for students to tinker and realize their ideas  

Kyle Anderson

What seems to interest students is what has to do with their actual lives 

Have we presented to students?

Response: 

Not yet brought up to students, but this will not compromise the support we offer students – just another component to deepen their educational experience

Laura Anker

Exciting model – as it is presented – integrated commuter with residential students is exciting

Most important part of FYE is CALL – mission-drive part of this experience. With regards to LEAP – can we integrate into internships… how do we see community/civic action as part of residential model?

Response: 

Believes that OW has at core engagement and this won’t affect

Andrew Mattson

We need engaged students, community engaged through departments and majors – Academic Affairs needs money, departments need money to do engagement activities and it is stressful to hear that now money will go to other events and faculty are just asking to go support this other programming rather than planning our own events

Response

This is not saying faculty have to take part in other peoples’ planning and events

Wants this to help provide resources for the

Clear that we hope to get more resources, and thinks we do have resources – we just need to re-organize how our resources are currently employed 

HANOVER

Assessment - Look at data to inform best practices

Hanover will provide us with this data (engine to drive best practices)

They will take any tasks we give them, and they will do research action plan AND then they will provide us with 1600 research studies (white papers) which everyone on campus can access as a library of best practices and data-rich resources to inform us as a community 

Cabinet has identified first three tasks for next year 

Enrollment

Branding and marketing

Academic Portfolio Optimization 

Concerns: will we lose departments? President Sams has not seen this, but sees new directions we can go in, not majors to close down

Helps inform faculty on day-to-day basis

Selected Hanover as best value from five vendors

Ashlee Lien question - costs of Hanover? How does this fit into our finances with bringing the campus up to standard and other financial challenges we face.

Response: We interrupted some of our use of EAB, to allocate resources for Hanover, which is a more robust product 

Alireza Ebrahimi question: we have to inform them what we want, so they can predict/assess. Are you going to look at other small residential colleges for experiences? Or look at only a small part of college residential. 

Response: want a framework for everyone to ‘play’ in – how do interactions play out in best. Don’t know how history or FYE will specifically interact in this model – but wants a wide planning process 

Jennie D’Ambroise clarified: are these funds known or published? 

Response: this wasn’t made without the faculty knowing since Cabinet took part in discussions 

This isn’t something President Sams envisioned would be worked through with the Planning and Budget Committee

Perhaps this question of Hanover can be brought back up to Cabinet and these concerns can be further discussed

Assessment Presentation, Courtney Raeford (Director Institutional Research) 

Discussing changes to assessment. “Assessment is collaborative, intentional and iterative process” 

Why? This should help us reflect on strengths, weaknesses, and improvements 

Helps with strategic planning, program review, grants, AND we’re accountable to external factors (Middle States, SUNY)

March 1 Middle States’ response due

They want aligned, systematic, sustained, and assessment items are ‘used’ 

Want a system in place that aligns assessment with institutional vision and have a process in place for undertaking assessments (academic and administrative) 

Institutional response: Set up the Institutional Effectiveness Committee (IEC), Presidential Committee, develop system of assessment activities as a sustained process to embed assessment culture at OW

Besides Institutional Effectiveness Committee, set up WEAVE, 

WEAVE also helps 

Centralized program to manage program – this does not DO the work, departments still need to determine what/how they want to do assessments, but all information is collected with the WEAVE program

WEAVE will be launched soon, there will be electronic guides and tutorials

WEAVE demonstration: departments come up with assessment, outcomes, success criteria, what happened, and what do departments plan to do in next step (helps “close the loop”)

Design component (curriculum map): can input classes from OW, visualize what curriculum map looks like 

Academic and administrative assessments will be accessible/possible to map 

REPORT Function: demonstrate to Middles States that we’re serious and provides evidence that we’re implementing changes 

Fill out a report very quickly to send them – select programs, elements of plan, and then get information about plans and what happened and how it will change moving forward    		

Make sure everyone gets training so this is possible

Jennie D’Ambroise asked about Sharepoint site – are there resources to look through?

Response: yes, IUPUI - assessment institute posts sessions

Temple University demonstrates how to report and use assessment findings to change practices  	

Hope to compile national resources and get to discipline specific templates and examples

Ruomei Gao question: individual reports or only departmental?

Response: yes, should be possible, but right now no users have been assigned yet (regarding access – read, edit access, etc) 

Alireza Ebrahimi question: any software besides SPSS and SAS?

Response: using SPSS but not SAS, working on more comprehensive dashboards 

Data for program review should be available to departments

Want to look at student outcomes across departments 

Mike Kavic: thanked Courtney and John Estes, as well as Ashlee and Ryoko regarding academic assessment

Departments should engage with these two and with assessment fellows

Need to place assessments into WEAVE+

Stakes are HIGH for Middle States, so we need supplemental report to go well or we can be put on probation 

Frank Sanacory question: WEAVE – we upload files – are these locked or editable? 

Response: to be determined by program. WEAVE creates own program – you can lock or not and make own deadlines

Still creating institutional process
