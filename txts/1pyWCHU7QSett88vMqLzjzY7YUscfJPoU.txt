Re:

Date:

: Rational Fiscal Policy

January 24, 2003

RATIONALE
WHEREAS the economic and scientific competitiveness of New York State is
dependent on an educated citizenry, and
WHEREAS

the quality of that education is linked to appropriate state support, and

WHEREAS SUNY is committed to providing broad access to quality state supported
higher education, and
WHEREAS

there is a clear indication that greater numbers of New York State students

will seek a SUNY

education, and

WHEREAS the lack of a long range funding policy makes financial planning difficult
for students and their parents, SUNY campuses, and the State of New York,
WHEREAS

the lack of a long range funding policy threatens continuation of excellence

in teaching and research that exists within the SUNY system, and hence long term

ability to compete with other universities;

RESOLUTION
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the University Faculty Senate endorses the
fundamental concepts and recommendations contained in the final report of the Task
Force on Rational Fiscal Policy, and.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Chancellor, working with the University
Faculty Senate, the SUNY Board of Trustees, governmental bodies, and other

appropriate constituencies develop a long term, rational fiscal policy for SUNY which
incorporates the fundamental concepts and recommendations contained in the Rational
Fiscal Policy Report.
