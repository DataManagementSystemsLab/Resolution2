Please note the following FUAC local SUNY Old Westbury Policies and Procedures for
reviewing applicant files:
1. In order to streamline the review of all applicant files, FUAC will follow the current SUNY award
Policies and Procedures guidelines for each award category.
2. FUAC will not accept incomplete files or files submitted after the aforementioned deadlines.
3. A comprehensive self-evaluation is expected that includes the arc of all activities submitted
relevant to the award beginning from the applicant’s initial appointment. This will be used by
FUAC to contextualize the merit of the applicant’s file when putting forth an applicant to the
President for review and approval.
4. A comprehensive file adhering to the SUNY award specific Policies and Procedures is expected
including a review of the arc of all activities submitted relevant to the award beginning from
applicant’s initial appointment. This will be used by FUAC to contextualize the merit of the
applicant’s file when putting forth an applicant to the President for review and approval.
5. FUAC will not consider letters of support, either internal or external, that have been used for other
purposes. All letters of support must be specific to the award in which the applicant is seeking
consideration.
6. FUAC requires that the entire file must be created for the specific award application. The only
exception is if an applicant submitted a file and was not selected. In this case, the applicant may
reapply the next year without recreating the file anew and may include additional information that
has been completed/accomplished and updated and/or revised since the original application that
was submitted. Internal and external letters are acceptable for a period of two-years from the initial
application.
7. Letters from other faculty in the applicant’s department are strongly encouraged, but the main
nomination should come from a single nominator that can make the best case for the nominee.
8. All letters must be current (i.e., within the last two-years) regarding the specific award, except as
noted above under bullet 5.
9. Faculty that are currently serving on FUAC must not be asked to write letters of support.
10. The file must contain a table of contents.
11. The self-evaluation portion of the file must include and stress the applicant’s productivity and
philosophy of scholarship and creative activities, librarianship, research, teaching or service.
12. Since SUNY Policies and Procedures guidelines for these awards may be modified, any conflicts
between SUNY and the local Old Westbury Policies and Procedures above will be resolved by
deference to SUNY Policies and Procedures that are currently in effect at the time of the applicant’s
files submission. Please note and follow the Procedures for Faculty University Awards (Appendix
3

V) in the Bylaws. Copies of the Bylaws and Award Procedures are in the Faculty Senate Office or
can be obtained by contacting the Faculty Senate Secretary, Dinorah I. Martinez, at Ext.: 3117,
martinezd@oldwestbury.edu.
