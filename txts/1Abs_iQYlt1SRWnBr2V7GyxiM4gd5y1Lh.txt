Physics is the most fundamental of the sciences, investigating the basic laws of nature and asking deep questions about
the properties of matter, the origin and fate of the universe, and nature of space and time. Undergraduate training in
physics provides a solid grounding in quantitative problem solving, analytical reasoning, and mathematical modeling.
The Bachelor of Science degree in physics has both a standard track and several alternative career-oriented
concentrations. All bachelor’s students will take the full physics core of foundational courses and upper division core
courses. Further advanced courses will be determined by the choice of concentration.
General Physics concentration: A traditional physics B.S. program meant for students intending to continue to graduate
school or pursue a career in STEM. Students will take a further two advanced math and two advanced physics courses,
for a total of 69 credits.
Health Science concentration: For students pursuing a career in the medical professions. Beyond the physics core
curriculum, students will take an additional 21 credits coursework in biology and chemistry that is appropriate for MCAT
preparations, for a total of 76 credits.
Quantitative Finance concentration: This track contains an additional 32 credits of coursework in finance and computer
science, with a capstone course in econophysics, giving a total of 79 credits.
Applied/Computational concentration: The coursework will consist of the foundational physics core, the upper division
core, and an additional 5 courses in mathematics and computer science, for a total of 74 credits.
b) What are the program’s educational and, if appropriate, career objectives, and the program’s primary student learning
outcomes (SLOs)? NOTE: SLOs are defined by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education in the Characteristics
of Excellence in Higher Education (2006) as “clearly articulated written statements, expressed in observable terms, of key
learning outcomes: the knowledge, skills and competencies that students are expected to exhibit upon completion of the
program.”
Educational objectives:
Students will gain a fundamental understanding of the basic laws of nature and the ability to ask and answer deep
questions about the properties of matter, the origin and fate of the universe, and nature of space and time. Students will
4

receive a solid grounding in quantitative problem solving, analytical reasoning, basic programming, and mathematical
modeling.

5. Communicate scientific ideas and information clearly in both written and oral formats.
c) How does the program relate to the institution’s and SUNY’s mission and strategic goals and priorities? What is the

program’s importance to the institution, and its relationship to existing and/or projected programs and its expected impact
on them? As applicable, how does the program reflect diversity and/or international perspectives? For doctoral programs,
what is this program’s potential to achieve national and/or international prominence and distinction?
SUNY Old Westbury’s Mission Statement is as follows:
Mission Statement
SUNY Old Westbury is a dynamic and diverse public liberal arts college that fosters academic excellence through close
interaction among students, faculty and staff. Old Westbury weaves the values of integrity, community engagement, and
global citizenship into the fabric of its academic programs and campus life. In an environment that cultivates critical
thinking, empathy, creativity and intercultural understanding, we endeavor to stimulate a passion for learning and a
commitment to building a more just and sustainable world. The College is a community of students, teachers, staff, and
alumni bound together in mutual support, respect, and dedication to the Mission.
The creation of a Physics B.S. program supports the mission of SUNY OW in variety of ways. Most directly, it addresses
being a “public liberal arts college that fosters academic excellence” and creating “an environment that cultivates critical
thinking.” Physics is a core scientific discipline and is an essential STEM field of study. It has been called the “crown
jewel” of science because it lies at the root of all physical phenomena. Moreover, physics requires analytical skills that
are applicable to a wide variety of career paths. Studying physics prepares graduates to tackle almost any problemsolving oriented challenge confronting them. This is a motivating factor for the variety of career concentrations that are
part of our proposed curriculum.
SUNY OW has experienced strong enrollment growth in STEM related fields in the past decade (from 346 students in
2010 to 622 students in 2020). However, the College unfortunately offers few undergraduate STEM programs. There are
currently only five distinct undergraduate STEM programs: biology, biochemistry, chemistry, math, and computer
science. Only three of these are in the natural sciences. Physics will make a strong addition to the portfolio of programs
and give students another much needed option in STEM and the natural sciences. Our career concentrations compliment,
without duplicating, existing programs related to health science and in the school of business.
5

In the context of SUNY OW’s Strategic Plan 2018-2023 (https://www.oldwestbury.edu/about/president/2018-2023strategic-plan), the creation of the physics program contributes in a variety of ways. Specifically, it supports Goal 1:
Support Student Success, Objective 1A: Improve Student Retention and Completion, Strategy 1A: Expand and renovate
teaching and research facilities to meet current and future growth in high-needs STEM degree offerings and related
faculty research. It also supports Goal 2: Promote Academic Excellence. The addition of physics is one step in a
comprehensive effort to strengthen and broaden the natural sciences at SUNY Old Westbury. Starting in 2022 the Natural
Science Building at SUNY OW will undergo a complete renovation, providing modernized, flexible teaching and
laboratory spaces and state-of-the-art research and computational facilities. The building is being purposefully redesigned to house a new physics program, with astronomical viewing facilities, updated physics teaching laboratories,
flexible instructional computing classrooms, and collaborative student and faculty discussion spaces.
With a mission to promote diversity and social justice, SUNY OW has a long-standing goal of addressing the
underrepresentation of minority populations in STEM. The problem is especially acute in physics: out of all bachelor’s
degrees in physics awarded in 2018, only 4% were granted to African-American students and 8% to Hispanics (American
Institute of Physics, “Physics Bachelor’s Degrees: 2018”, 2020 AIP). SUNY OW is uniquely well positioned to take on
this challenge. Old Westbury is the most diverse SUNY campus, is one of the most diverse universities in the country
(Study.com, “Top 50 Colleges for Racial and Cultural Diversity”, June 2019), and is a leader in promoting social mobility
(US News and World Reports, “Top Performers in Social Mobility”, 2021). Over one-quarter of the student body
described themselves as African-American, and another quarter as Hispanic and SUNY OW was recently officially
designated a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI). The National Science Foundation identified, as one of its 10 Big Ideas
(National Science Foundation, Special Report: “NSF’s 10 Big Ideas”, 2017), attracting, educating, and empowering a
diverse STEM workforce, representative of the country, as a top priority. In this way, SUNY OW’s and national strategic
goals align, and the physics program would be an essential addition in helping SUNY OW contribute to the goal of a
diverse STEM workforce.
An excerpt of SUNY’s mission statement is as follows.
Mission Statement
The mission of the state university system shall be to provide to the people of New York educational services of the highest
quality, with the broadest possible access, fully representative of all segments of the population in a complete range of
academic, professional and vocational postsecondary programs including such additional activities in pursuit of these
objectives as are necessary or customary. These services and activities shall be offered through a geographically
distributed comprehensive system of diverse campuses which shall have differentiated, and designated missions designed
to provide a comprehensive program of higher education, to meet the needs of both traditional and non-traditional
students and to address local, regional and state needs and goals.
•

recognizes the fundamental role of its responsibilities in undergraduate education and provides a full range of
graduate and professional education that reflects the opportunity for individual choice and the needs of society;

See the rest of the Mission Statement here (https://www.suny.edu/about/mission/).
As one of SUNY's 4-year colleges, Old Westbury has a responsibility to provide a broad-based liberal education, with
offerings in all major core disciplines. Physics is a primary example of such a core discipline, and the primacy of physics
is recognized at SUNY OW’s peer institutions. SUNY OW is currently one of only three out of the thirteen
comprehensive colleges in the SUNY system to not offer a bachelor's degree in Physics. Moreover, SUNY OW is the
only SUNY comprehensive college on Long Island. Given that a central theme of SUNY’s mission is educational access,
the need for this program is self-evident.
The proposed physics program aligns well with SUNY strategic priorities. The career concentrations in the proposed
curriculum directly address the need to “close the gap” between graduation and entry into a successful career path. As
part of the career concentrations, internship opportunities and partnerships with local companies will be developed. This
is particularly true of the of the Quantitative Finance Concentration. Given the proximity of SUNY OW to New York
6

City, the financial capital of the world, this concentration will open a direct path for graduates to a career in a major
regional industry. The Health Science Concentration addresses the need for more workers in the healthcare industry by
preparing students for graduate/professional study in health-related programs. The applied/computational concentration
addresses the need for technically skilled workers, particularly in the energy sector. This is especially important given that
this sector of the Long Island economy is expected to grow in the coming years, (Long Island Press, July 19, 2019, “NY
Announces Nation’s Largest Wind Farm to be Built off Long Island”, https://www.longislandpress.com/2019/07/19/nyannounces-nations-largest-wind-farm-to-be-built-off-long-island/).
d) How were faculty involved in the program’s design? Describe input by external partners, if any (e.g., employers and
institutions offering further education?
The design of this program was the result of a collaborative effort by the physics faculty in the Chemistry and
Physics Department, who oversaw the development throughout its various phases. Furthermore, given the
interdisciplinary nature of the program, the Department of Biological Sciences, the School of Business, and
especially the Department of Math/CIS were also consulted during the program development at various times.
e) How did input, if any, from external partners (e.g., educational institutions and employers) or standards influence the
program’s design? If the program is designed to meet specialized accreditation or other external standards, such as the
educational requirements in Commissioner’s Regulations for the Profession, append a side-by-side chart to show how the
program’s components meet those external standards. If SED’s Office of the Professions requires a specialized form for the
profession to which the proposed program leads, append a completed form at the end of this document.

Determination of total enrollment:
Assume average graduation rate of 7 per year (for undergraduate programs without a master/PhD): (American Institute of
Physics, “Size of Undergraduate Physics and Astronomy Programs”, July 2020,
https://www.aip.org/statistics/reports/size-of-undergraduate-programs-16-18)

7

Assume graduation rate of 60%: (National Center for Education Statistics, “Undergraduate Retention and Graduation
Rates”, April 2020 https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=40)
The number of first year students is then: fy = 11.67
Assuming an even dropout rate over four years gives a dropout rate per year of: d = 1.17
The total number of students for each year is then calculated as:
n (n − 1)
year𝑛 = 𝑛 fy − d
𝑛<5
2
year5 = 5 fy − 10 d − 7
Determination of full-time and part-time enrollment:
The full-time and part-time enrollments were calculated using 85% for full-time and 15% for part-time. These numbers
are for the natural and life science students at SUNY Old Westbury (SUNY Old Westbury website, “Fast Facts”,
https://www.suny.edu/about/fast-facts/)

h) Program Impact on SUNY and New York State
h)(1)

Need: What is the need for the proposed program in terms of the clientele it will serve and the educational
and/or economic needs of the area and New York State? How was need determined? Why are similar
programs, if any, not meeting the need?

There is tremendous need for more trained physicists in the State of New York. According to the New York State
Department of Labor the employment need for physics is projected to increase by 22% from 2016 to 2026. This
represents one of the largest projected increases for any occupation in New York State over that time period (NY State
Dept of Labor, Long-Term Occupational Employment Projections 2016-2026, https://dol.ny.gov/statistics-statewide-andregional-long-term-occupational-projections). Nationwide there is growing demand for physicists: According to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment for PhD physicists expected to grow 7% in the next 10 years. (U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics, Occupational Outlook Handbook, Physicists and Astronomers, April 2021, https://www.bls.gov/ooh/lifephysical-and-social-science/physicists-and-astronomers.htm)
The number of physics bachelor’s degrees awarded at US institutions has been increasing steadily for almost two decades,
averaging about a 5% increase a year, increasing 145% between 1999 and 2018. In the same period, the number of
STEM degrees conferred has increased 80%. In 2017-18, 35% of physics bachelor’s recipients graduated with a double
major. An increasing number of physics departments offer a curricular focus to their major, accounting for 30% of all
physics bachelor’s degrees awarded in 2017-18, with engineering being the most popular. (American Institute of Physics,
“Physics Bachelor's Degrees 2018:”, Aug. 2020, https://www.aip.org/statistics/reports/physics-bachelors-degrees-2018)

After graduation, physics bachelors follow a variety of career paths. Within one year of receiving a degree from an
institution granting only bachelor’s degrees, 28% of students enroll in graduate programs in physics or astronomy, 19% in
graduate programs in other areas, including engineering, medicine, education, and business.
Undergraduate training in physics provides a solid grounding in quantitative problem solving, analytical reasoning, and
mathematical modeling, leading to the diversity of career paths. One year after degree, 48% of physics bachelors are in
the workforce, in a variety of fields; including engineering, computers or information systems, high school teachers, as

11

well as fields outside of STEM. (See the figures below.) (American Institute of Physics, “Employments and Careers in
Physics,” Apr. 2020, https://www.aip.org/file/src-employment-bookletpdf/download?token=TjIwEfsd).

The demand for quality STEM educators, especially in physics, is enormous and growing. School districts consistently
rank physics as the highest need area among all academic disciplines. A background in physics provides a firm scientific
foundation upon which to launch a career in education. Teachers with authentic research experience can more effectively
incorporate cutting edge research and communicate the process of scientific investigation. They are more able to
implement inquiry-based teaching methods, allowing them to bring the excitement of discovery to the next generation of
students. Furthermore, the establishment of the physics program at SUNY OW will allow the development of a physics
education program as part of SUNY OW’s School of Education.
Healthcare is a large and growing segment of the economy, and a firm foundation in quantitative science is necessary for
careers in medicine, dentistry, and other health professions. Many health professionals begin their careers in physics, and
students with Bachelor’s degrees in Physics have some of the highest average MCAT scores. The physical sciences have
the highest acceptance rate into medical schools (48%), while in comparison biological sciences have a 42% acceptance
rate and health sciences have a 39% acceptance rate. (Association of American Medical Colleges, “2020 FACTS:

Applicants and Matriculants Data”, https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/students-residents/interactive-data/2020-factsapplicants-and-matriculants-data)
Financial engineering or quantitative finance is a rapidly growing sector of the financial industry whose epicenter is in
New York City. Professionals that work in quantitative finance have rigorous quantitative training and the primary focus
of their work is to model particular financial instruments both analytically and numerically. A physics degree is viewed
as extremely desirable by employers and a large percentage of those employed in this field come from a physics
background. Moreover, employers are developing programs and initiatives to address diversity and inclusion in their
workplaces (for example: Goldman Sach, “2019 Diversity and Inclusion”, https://www.goldmansachs.com/ourfirm/history/moments/2019-diversity-and-inclusion.html). SUNY OW is a minority serving institution, and the physics
program, with its quantitative finance concentration, would be uniquely situated to address this call.
Engineering is perhaps the most straightforward of all physics applications. The basic knowledge of mechanical and
electrical phenomena which form the basis for most engineering projects are at the heart of physics as a discipline. A
physics degree is a strong foundation for any career in engineering.

undergraduate students. To demonstrate adequate planning for transfer under SUNY’ s student mobility
policy, Section 9 of this form on SUNY Undergraduate Transfer must be completed for programs leading to
Associate in Arts (A.A.) and Associate in Science (A.S.) and for baccalaureate programs anticipating transfer
enrollment.

See Section 9.b.
2.4. Admissions
a) What are all admission requirements for students in this program? Please note those that differ from the institution’s
minimum admissions requirements and explain why they differ.
There are no special admission requirements for this program beyond the College’s normal admission requirements.
b) What is the process for evaluating exceptions to those requirements?
The evaluation of exceptions to the admissions requirements will follow the same process as that used by the College.
c) How will the institution encourage enrollment in this program by persons from groups historically underrepresented in
the institution, discipline, or occupation?
Currently the College is a minority serving institution and was recently designated a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).
The college is committed to inclusiveness and diversity as reflected in its mission statement and its commitment to social
justice, and to building a more just and sustainable world. U.S. News & World Report has named Old Westbury as fourth
in campus ethnic diversity among National Liberal Arts Colleges in the United States. It is the 15th consecutive year the
College has ranked among the top colleges where students are most likely to encounter undergraduates from different
racial or ethnic groups. (US News and World Report “SUNY-College at Old Westbury’s 2020 rankings,”
https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/suny-old-westbury-7109)
In 2018, 2019, and 2020, the College received the Higher Education Excellence in Diversity (HEED) Award. The HEED
Award is the only national honor recognizing U.S. colleges and universities that demonstrate an outstanding commitment
to diversity and inclusion across their campus. This is also captured in Old Westbury’s 2018-2023 Strategic Plan vision
statement - “Old Westbury, SUNY's most diverse campus, is a regional academic leader that fosters personal growth and
prepares students to embrace the social and environmental responsibilities of our 21st century global community.”

2.5. Academic and Other Support Services
Summarize the academic advising and support services available to help students succeed in the program.
Four years ago, the College launched a Student Success initiative with the creation of a Student Success Center where
tutoring, peer-mentoring, research opportunities, advising, student completion coaching, transfer student coordinators, and
14

career planning services are offered in a central location in the Campus Center building. In addition, the College acquired
a Student Success application, EAB Navigate, linked to the student and faculty portals pairing students in any of the
programs housed in the Chemistry and Physics Department with a faculty member in the department. Academic advising
is an essential component of each of the department’s programs. A faculty advisor will serve as a primary source of
information and support during the students’ tenure in the program. The advisor serves as a mentor in relation to career
planning, plans for future study, academic progress, and other issues that impact students’ performance in the program.
Majors will be expected to meet regularly with advisors each semester. Such meetings will provide opportunities for both
in-depth discussion of personal experiences, including the application of theory to practice, and the implications of
research methods and analysis in cultural studies.
Furthermore, all students in the program would have access to the full range of services provided by the College. First
Year students receive advising in the First Year Experience program, then move to advising with the Academic Advising
Center as sophomores. In coordination with the Student Success Center, both assist students in understanding and
meeting the College's academic requirements for graduation, including SUNY General Education and College Liberal
Education requirements. They also assist with online degree evaluation, particularly for transfer students who need to
understand how their previous coursework has been evaluated. Once students declare their major, they are assigned to
faculty department advisors.
Informational Technology Services (ITS) provides all campus-wide technological support in terms of the installation,
maintenance and upgrade of hardware and software, and the learning management system (BlackBoard). All students are
issued e-mail accounts and server space to store data and files on the campus network. Similarly, faculty members are
issued e-mail accounts and server space to store data and files that can be shared at will with students on the campus
network. The College provides ample access to computer labs for all students taking courses within the department’s
programs and WiFi access is available throughout its buildings.
Students also receive academic support from the Writing Center, where assistance and non-credit workshops are
provided. Services at the Writing Center have been particularly beneficial to some Biology majors whose first language
is not English. Academic support is also provided by the Math Center and the Tutoring Center. In addition, free on-line
tutoring is available for any student who might need help in a variety of subjects through Smarthinking.
The Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP) also offers workshops, research opportunities,
information on internships, and peer-tutoring throughout the year.
2.6. Prior Learning Assessment
If this program will grant credit based on Prior Learning Assessment, describe the methods of evaluating the learning and
the maximum number of credits allowed, or check here [X] if not applicable.
2.7. Program Assessment and Improvement
Describe how this program’s achievement of its objectives will be assessed, in accordance with SUNY policy, including the
date of the program’s initial assessment and the length (in years) of the assessment cycle. Explain plans for assessing
achievement of students learning outcomes during the program and success after completion of the program. Append at the
end of this form, a plan or curriculum map showing the courses in which the program’s educational and, if appropriate,
career objectives – from Item 2.3(b) of this form – will be taught and assessed. NOTE: The University Faculty Senate’s
Guide for the Evaluation of Undergraduate Programs is a helpful reference.
In accordance with SUNY policy, the College carries out a departmental Five-Year Program Review process, including
an external evaluation. This review process is coordinated by the Curriculum and Academic Planning Committee (CAP,
15

a Faculty Governance committee). The proposed degree would be reviewed as part of the Chemistry and Physics
Department.
Student Learning Outcomes will be assessed annually over the five-year review period and results included in the selfstudy report. The proposed physics program will be assessed with a comprehensive portfolio of both formative and
summative assessment tools. We will make use of available assessment instruments specialized for physics, such as those
provided by the APPT (American Association of Physics Teachers) and PhysPort (https://www.physport.org/). We will
use a combination of embedded questions, standardized rubrics, and student and faculty surveys.
The SLOs are summarized below.
1. Understand, recall, and apply the core principles of the laws of physics including classical mechanics, electricity
and magnetism, quantum mechanics, relativity, and statistical mechanics.
2. Apply mathematical skills, programming skills and physics concepts together to model physical systems.
3. Apply the process of science and the scientific method including generating theoretical principles, testing
hypotheses, experimental design, and developing problem-solving strategies.
4. Collect, evaluate, and interpret experimental data, including having a detailed understanding of the electronics and
other equipment commonly used in laboratory settings.
5. Communicate scientific ideas and information clearly in both written and oral formats.
A curriculum map indicating in which courses the Student Learning Outcomes will be taught and assessed is attached as
Appendix 1. The SLOs will be assessed in CP2260/CP2261 to give a baseline for evaluating progress through the upper
division courses. SLO 2 is excluded from this initial assessment. SLO 1 will be assessed using embedded test questions
in the upper division courses. SLO 2 will be assessed using embedded test questions and a rubric evaluating student
competencies in CP3900. SLO 3 will be assessed using a rubric graded on the student’s final project presented in senior
seminar (CP5920/CP5921). SLO 4 will be assessed using a rubric evaluating student competencies in CP3900. SLO 3
will be assessed using a rubric graded on the student’s presentations and written work presented in senior seminar
(CP5920/CP5921). The rubrics will be designed using the Scientific Abilities Assessment Rubrics (SAAR) or similar
open educational resources.
Physics majors will be paired up with a faculty mentor and have meetings once a semester. Student engagement will be
evaluated through surveys designed around the NSSE or similar resources to be completed by both the faculty and the
student after each meeting. Graduation data and follow-up data will be collected through a combination of recording
College wide and SUNY wide statistics, as well as student and graduate surveys.
In general, all data will be recorded anonymously. The above assessment strategy is subject to change based on feedback
and student needs as well as changes in College, SUNY, and Middle States goals and guidelines.
The Five Year Review self study report will be generated in accordance with current SUNY and Middle States
guidelines. A sample outline is as follows:
• Mission and Learning Outcomes
• Program Curriculum and Design
• Students
• Faculty
• Support, Resources and Facilities
• Assessment of SLOs
• External Evaluation and Response
• Improvement Loop

Assuming enrollment targets are met,
an additional faculty will be needed to
staff the upper division courses.

Section 5. Financial Resources and Instructional Facilities
a) What is the resource plan for ensuring the success of the proposed program over time? Summarize the
instructional facilities and equipment committed to ensure the success of the program. Please explain new
and/or reallocated resources over the first five years for operations, including faculty and other personnel,
the library, equipment, laboratories, and supplies. Also include resources for capital projects and other
expenses.
The Chemistry and Physics department currently has four full-time tenured or tenure track physics faculty
members, who will continue to teach three courses per semester, provide academic advising, and mentor
student research. Four new upper division courses (Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Relativity, and
Experimental Physics and Electronics Lab) will be taught every other year, beginning in year 2. Starting in
year 3, one additional advanced course (Econophysics, Applied Mechanics, or other advanced topics course)
will be offered per year. The additional course load will be initially covered by having adjunct faculty teach
some of the lower division and service courses. As enrollment grows, another tenure-track faculty member is
anticipated to be added in year 4 to cover the increased course load and provide additional advising and
research mentoring.
Existing laboratory infrastructure serves the needs of the introductory sequence courses (General Physics 13). Additional equipment will be needed in year 3 when the upper division lab (Experimental Physics and
Electronics) is introduced. If enrollment targets are met an additional purchase of new equipment will be
required in year 5. After the initial purchase of new equipment in year 3 and, if necessary, year 5, there will
be modest ongoing maintenance and supply costs every other year, when the course is taught. Continued
growth in enrollment in the physical and life sciences will eventually necessitate an additional lab technician.
Current staff are trained in chemistry and biology, a lab technician with physics expertise should be hired to
complement current staff expertise.
b) Complete the five-year SUNY Program Expenses Table, below, consistent with the resource plan summary.
Enter the anticipated academic years in the top row of this table. List all resources that will be engaged
specifically as a result of the proposed program (e.g., a new faculty position or additional library resources). If
they represent a continuing cost, new resources for a given year should be included in the subsequent year(s),
with adjustments for inflation or negotiated compensation. Include explanatory notes as needed.

Section 6. Library Resources
a) Summarize the analysis of library collection resources and needs for this program by the collection
librarian and program faculty. Include an assessment of existing library resources and accessibility to
those resources for students enrolled in the program in all formats, including the institution’s
implementation of SUNY Connect, the SUNY-wide electronic library program.
The majority of current physics research is available publicly through the preprint archive
(https://arxiv.org/). For older articles, the library contains access to all major journals expected for the
program, either onsite or electronically through several searchable databases, other electronic resources,
or interlibrary loan. If there is an item in SUNY Connect that is not in the Old Westbury library
collection, an inter-library loan request may be placed to obtain the requested item. The library’s
catalog is available online and most electronic resources are available from any web browser. The
Director of the Library makes every effort to make new acquisitions at the request of faculty.
b) Describe the institution’s response to identified collection needs and its plan for library development.
The library uses a patron-driven process to determine acquisitions, under which faculty and students
serve as the drivers for the growth of the collection.
Section 7. External Evaluation
SUNY requires external evaluation of all proposed bachelor’s degree programs and may request an
evaluation for a proposed associate degree or certificate program in a new or emerging field or for other
reasons.
Is an external evaluation required? [ ] No [X] Yes
If yes, list below all SUNY-approved evaluators who conducted evaluations (adding rows as needed),
and append at the end of this document each original, signed External Evaluation Report. NOTE:
To select external evaluators, a campus sends 3-5 proposed evaluators’ names, titles and CVs to the
assigned SUNY Program Reviewer, expresses its preferences and requests approval.
Evaluator #1:
Name: Nathan Magee
Title: Professor of Physics
Institution: The College of New Jersey

Evaluator #2:
Name: Neil Aaronson
Title: Professor of Physics
Institution: Stockton University

Section 8. Institutional Response to External Evaluator Reports
As applicable, append at the end of this document a single Institutional Response to all External Evaluation
Reports.
Section 9. SUNY Undergraduate Transfer
The State University views as one of its highest priorities the facilitation of transfer.

Grade of Incomplete:
The College bulletin allows faculty to assign a grade of Incomplete when circumstances such as accident or illness
make it impossible for the student to complete course work by the end of the semester; as long as the student has
completed most of the course work at a passing level. An Incomplete cannot be used to allow students to “try again”
the following semester.
Withdrawal:
The College bulletin gives the deadline for withdrawal without a faculty signature, and the last day for withdrawal
with a signature. Policy on Lecture and Laboratory Withdrawals Students are advised that if, before the 7th week of
42

the semester, you withdraw from this lecture course, then you should also withdraw from the laboratory
course. Withdrawals after the 7th week should be discussed with both your lecture and laboratory instructors.
Academic Integrity:
Plagiarism is presenting the work of others as if it is our own. Providing or receiving exam questions or answers to
another person or entity is academic dishonesty. Plagiarism and other academic dishonesty, such as cheating on an
exam, will be punished by a grade of F (failure) in the course and will be reported to the Dean. Know what academic
dishonesty is and how to avoid it - in this matter, ignorance is never an acceptable excuse. Further details can be

Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the electronics and instrumentation used in experiments. Topics include DC
and AC circuits, filters, power supplies, transistors, diodes and operational amplifiers and if time permits analog to
digital converters and logic. This is primarily a lab class, but time will also be spent in and out of the class on the
mathematical description of the circuits and instruments, as well as, discussions of the theory underlying modern
components, such as the diode and transistor.

Credits: 3
Co-requisite: CP 3700

Learning Outcomes:
•

Students will be able to design experiments from the ground up in order to test their hypotheses and explore
theoretical models.

•

Students will gain a fundamental understanding of the electronic equipment and instrumentation used in
experiments.

•

Students will be able to communicate scientific information in both written and oral formats.

Classes:
One 180-minute meeting per week. The meeting will consist of an introductory lecture lasting around an hour after
which students will work on laboratory activities. The activities will include testing theoretical models and
principles, exploring the behavior of circuits and instruments, and designing, creating and testing circuits/instruments
for specific purposes.

Assessments:
Homework:
Weekly assignments will be given and will be due the following week. The assignments will contain theoretical
questions based on the lecture and lab activities. Data and analysis for the weekly lab will also be included as part of
the assignment. Late assignments will not be accepted without prior approval.

Lab reports:
The course will have four lab reports structured around four different units: DC circuits, AC circuits,
diodes/transistors and operational amplifiers. For a given unit, the report will contain a discussion of relevant
physical principles and theoretical models. Students will select experiments from the course to demonstrate and
illustrate the theoretical discussion. You do not need to include all experiments done in the class. Circuit schematics,
essential data and data analysis should be included for each experiment included in your lab report. The report should
be written concisely and use scientific language and arguments.

Final project:
As a final project, the student will design and perform their own experiment using the ideas and techniques learned
throughout the semester.

CP 4900 - Econophysics
Spring

Course Description:
Physics has a long and storied tradition of applying statistical methods to understand complex systems. Financial
markets are complex systems and are amenable to similar treatments. Econophysics is the application of ideas from
statistical physics to the financial markets.
In this course, we will introduce the dynamics of markets from a physics perspective. We will introduce the
statistical methods needed to model financial markets: classes of Brownian motion, probability distributions and limit
theorems. Comparison with other physical systems will be used to develop intuitions for these methods.
Stochastic models for price dynamics will be introduced. Their applicability and limitations will be discussed. We
will develop time-dependent models for equity valuations, such as the Black-Scholes equation which is used in
options pricing. Real world markets such as equity stock markets, fixed income markets, and commodities markets
will be considered.

Credits: 3
Prerequisites: BU4762, CS2510

Learning Outcomes:
•

Students will have an understanding of the modern applications of physics to the interdisciplinary fields of
finance and economics.

•

Students will understand and be able to apply stochastic and computational methods to make predictions for
non-analytic systems.

Classes:
Two 90-minute lectures per week. The classes will contain conceptual discussions, sample problems, and
demonstrations. Dialogue is welcomed, and you are strongly encouraged to ask questions.

Appendix 4: To-Be-Hired Faculty Description
TBH1, Assistant Professor (Starting year 4):
The Chemistry and Physics department seeks to hire a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Physics, to start in year 4 of
the physics program. The position is open to all areas of physics, but, ideally, the new faculty member will strengthen
and complement the existing research of the department. The position requires a PhD in Physics (or equivalent),
significant teaching experience, a strong record of research accomplishment, and the ability to attract external
funding. Additionally, a commitment to welcoming and mentoring students from underrepresented and underserved
populations is essential. The new faculty member will teach a range of physics courses, both upper and lower
division, maintain an active independent research program involving undergraduates, and participate in curricular
development and assessment of the physics program.

External Evaluation Report
Form 2D
Version 201-08-02

The External Evaluation Report is an important component of a new academic program proposal. The
external evaluator’s task is to examine the program proposal and related materials, visit the campus to discuss the
proposal with faculty and review related instructional resources and facilities, respond to the questions in this
Report form, and submit to the institution a signed report that speaks to the quality of, and need for, the proposed
program. The report should aim for completeness, accuracy and objectivity.
The institution is expected to review each External Evaluation Report it receives, prepare a single institutional
response to all reports, and, as appropriate, make changes to its program proposal and plan. Each separate
External Evaluation Report and the Institutional Response become part of the full program proposal that the
institution submits to SUNY for approval. If an external evaluation of the proposed program is required by the
New York State Education Department (SED), SUNY includes the External Evaluation Reports and Institutional
Response in the full proposal that it submits to SED for registration.

I. Program
1. Assess the program’s purpose, structure, and requirements as well as formal mechanisms for program
administration and evaluation. Address the program’s academic rigor and intellectual coherence.
A. Purpose
This evaluation is provided for a proposal of a new Physics B.S. degree program at SUNY Old Westbury.
The title of the new program proposal is “Physics, with General Physics, Health Science, Quantitative
Finance, and Applied/Computational Concentrations.”
The primary purpose of the new proposal is to establish an undergraduate B.S. degree program in physics at
SUNY Old Westbury, where none currently exists. Student interest and enrollment in STEM disciplines at
Old Westbury have increased substantially over the past decade, and the College is well-positioned to respond
to this demand with an increased set of degree options for STEM students at Old Westbury. The proposal
describes a carefully-crafted plan to offer several interdisciplinary degree concentrations in areas of physics
that are particularly relevant to the interests of Old Westbury students and faculty, and are also aligned with
fields that have strong regional career opportunities for graduates.
Physics degree programs are currently offered at approximately 750 higher educational institutions across the
United States, including 14 of the other SUNY campuses (AIP data, https://www.aip.org/statistics/reports/
size-undergraduate-physics-programs). Most institutions of similar size and mission offer physics degrees,
including most of SUNY’s Comprehensive Colleges. Particularly given the highly diverse ~5000 student
enrollment at Old Westbury, situated in the midst of a rich landscape of interdisciplinary STEM career
opportunities, the availability of a physics degree program at this campus would be a worthy priority for the
institution and for the SUNY system.
B. Structure:
The academic structure of the proposed program is as follows:
a) Foundational Core
A set of introductory physical science and mathematics courses and labs that all physics majors (and
many other STEM majors) would take. These courses generally already exist at Old Westbury as service
courses for other STEM majors, and their need, enrollment demand, and teaching infrastructure is already
firmly established. This set of foundational courses is fairly standard and well-aligned with national
benchmarks for lower-division physics majors.
b) Upper Division Core
A set of intermediate and advanced physics courses and labs that would be taken by all upper-level
physics majors. Several of these courses already exist in the Chemistry program and could be offered
jointly for both physics and chemistry students (e.g. Physical Chemistry/Thermodynamics and Math
Methods in Physical Sciences). Several of the other courses would be new class offerings (e.g.
Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Relativity, Experimental Physics Lab). For each new course, a course
structure and syllabus has been provided in the program proposal. The principal national disciplinary
organizations in physics (American Institute for Physics, ‘AIP’, and American Physical Society, ‘APS’)
do not offer degree accreditation or standard curricula for physics programs, however, this set of upperlevel courses is closely aligned with typical B.S. physics degree structures nationwide. The Relativity
course is perhaps the only class that might more typically appear as elective rather than a core
requirement. However, given the expertise of the proposing faculty and trends in the discipline, this
course should prove to be a unique and compelling part of the core.
6

c) Degree Concentration Courses
In addition to core courses, all physics majors would select courses from among 4 major concentrations:
i.)
General Physics Concentration
ii.)
Applied/Computational Concentration
iii.)
Health Science Concentration
iv.)
Quantitative Finance Concentration
These concentrations are intended to help students prepare for a variety of potential career paths,
including those that have unique job opportunities in the region. The selection of concentration courses is
very interdisciplinary, and would establish strong connections between the new physics program and
established offerings in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, and Finance/Management.
C. Requirements
The course requirements and sequencing for the program are clearly laid out in the program proposal.
The total credit requirements for each section of the program are as follows:
a)
b)
i.)
ii.)
iii.)
iv.)

Foundational Core (28 cr.)
Upper Division Core (27 cr.)
General Physics Concentration (14 cr.)
Applied/Computational Concentration (19 cr.)
Health Science Concentration (21 cr.)
Quantitative Finance Concentration (32 cr., 8 fewer core cr. req.)

This results in a total of 69 -79 credits required to complete the major, depending on concentration choice.
These course requirements establish an enticing, rigorous, and coherent set of physics courses in each
concentration, and also leave sufficient space for physics majors to complete general education courses
and still allow possibilities for other minors and double majors.
D. Administration and Evaluation
The B.S. in Physics would be administered through the existing Department of Chemistry and Physics at
Old Westbury. This department currently offers B.A. and B.S. degrees in Chemistry and a B.S. in
Biochemistry, and a minor in physics. The department has had a recent influx of physics faculty and
physics-interested students. The existing Chemistry and Physics department would be a natural
administrative home for the new Physics B.S. degree and for physics faculty and students. This should
cause minimal administrative disruption for current faculty and students, and help to support continued
synergy between academic and scholarly opportunities across physics and chemistry. It is conceivable
that a separate Department of Physics might eventually become desirable if the new program grows
significantly over coming years, but is definitely not necessary in the short-medium term. Continuing
program evaluation would occur through the University’s existing annual and five-year assessment cycles
for departments.

2. Comment on the special focus of this program, if any, as it relates to the discipline.
The core content of the proposed program is fairly typical for an undergraduate physics major in the United
States. However, the establishment of several interdisciplinary degree tracks is a fairly unique structure for a B.S.
physics degree program. These concentrations are designed to provide transparent pathways for students toward
different types of career opportunities. This should help with student recruiting, since physics programs
sometimes struggle to clearly articulate the range of careers that are available following completion of a physics
bachelor degree. The Health Science and Quantitative Finance concentrations are particularly unique. Very few
other Physics B.S. programs could offer similar curricular concentrations, and there is a strong alignment of these
fields with robust and growing employment sectors in New York and Long Island. This alignment should offer
excellent career prospects for graduates, and good potential for building institutional relationships or articulation
agreements with the regional business sector.

3. Comment on the plans and expectations for self-assessment and continuous improvement.
The new physics degree program would be evaluated through the Department of Chemistry and Physics and the
University’s existing annual and five-year assessment cycles. As the program grows and matures, self-assessment
can be used to evaluate the sufficiency and efficiency of the program’s structure, requirements, staffing, and
facilities.

4. Discuss the relationship of this program to other programs of the institution and collaboration with other
institutions, and assess available support from related programs.
The proposed physics B.S. degree program would be housed within the existing department of Chemistry and
Physics, and both core and concentration courses would include significant collaboration with chemistry students
and faculty. Core and concentration courses would also result in a modest increase in the number of students
taking Mathematics courses. The concentrations also would include significant new interdisciplinary
collaborations with the School of Business, Biology, and Computer Science. Chairs and faculty in each of these
programs expressed strong support for the new Physics program, and appear to be genuinely excited about the
prospect for new collaborations and new student opportunities. At least at first, the new physics major is not
expected to be especially large relative to existing STEM programs, so none of these related programs are
concerned about being able to accommodate slightly increased enrollments in their courses.

5. What is the evidence of need and demand for the program locally, in the State, and in the field at large?
What is the extent of occupational demand for graduates? What is the evidence that demand will continue?
The program proposal does a nice job of highlighting the excellent set of research statistics from AIP that
demonstrate the continuing national growth of physics as an undergraduate major, as well as the diverse set of
career paths that these graduates pursue. As mentioned above, the proposed concentrations in Health Sciences and
Quantitative Finance are particularly unique designs that are well-attuned to regional job opportunities on Long
Island and in New York City.
In the medium-term future, I think that the addition of a Physics Teacher Education concentration could further
address enormous regional demand and provide graduates who would make a big impact on local high school
science education. The severe shortage of highly qualified physics teachers, alongside existing teacher ed.
infrastructure at Old Westbury, and broad national support opportunities (e.g. Physics Teacher Education
8

Coalition) make this a promising area for future growth of the program. It makes good sense to first establish the
B.S. physics major as proposed, and demonstrate a stable and effective program before potentially pursuing an
accredited physics teacher education program.
II. Faculty

6. Evaluate the faculty, individually and collectively, with regard to training, experience, research and
publication, professional service, and recognition in the field.
The core physics faculty at the outset of the program would include the following faculty:

Professors Estes, Kavic, and Lippert are tenured/tenure-track faculty who would concentrate all of their
teaching and research in physics. Dr. Colineri’s research and teaching is at the interface of Physics and
Biology, and Dr. Jones is a visiting Physical Chemist, who would contribute to core instruction in physics and
in material physics & physical chemistry research. Approximately ~15 other faculty in Biology, Chemistry,
Mathematics, Computer Science, and Business would teach interdisciplinary foundational and concentration
courses.

7. Assess the faculty in terms of number and qualifications and plans for future staffing. Evaluate faculty
responsibilities for the proposed program, taking into account their other institutional and programmatic
commitments. Evaluate faculty activity in generating funds for research, training, facilities, equipment, etc.
Discuss any critical gaps and plans for addressing them.
The current number, qualifications, and expertise of the proposed core and affiliated physics faculty is
suitable for the initial roll-out of a new physics degree program Old Westbury. According to AIP statistics, in
2018, the average number of physics faculty members at PUI physics programs was 6.4 FTE. Naturally, the
typical number of FTE faculty members in physics normally scales with the number of B.S. graduates and
with the number of physics service courses offered (https://www.aip.org/statistics/data-graphics/averagenumber-bachelors-conferred-number-fte-faculty-members-physics).
9

It is noteworthy that all of the core physics faculty are actively publishing research in leading journals and
many of them also have an established record of attracting external research funding, including from
prestigious national funding agencies (NASA, NSF, Research Corp.)

8. Evaluate credentials and involvement of adjunct faculty and support personnel.
At this time, several adjunct faculty (to be hired) are anticipated to to play a minor role in the physics
program, providing instruction for a small proportion of the lower division and service courses. If
enrollments grow at faster-than-anticipated rates, an additional adjunct instructor or two would need to be
hired. In this region, it should not be very difficult to hire well-qualified adjunct faculty in physics as this
becomes necessary.
The chemistry and physics department currently shares administrative and lab support personnel. This current
arrangement should continue to function adequately in the short-to-medium term. If the program grows to the
extent that 10+ graduates are completing the program each year and one or two new full-time faculty are
needed, then an additional support person or adjusted administrative structure may need to be considered.

III. Students

9. Comment on the student population the program seeks to serve, and assess plans and projections for
student recruitment and enrollment.
The proposed program is intended to serve undergraduate students interested in STEM at Old Westbury.
According to interviews of students, faculty, and administrators, all stakeholders are in agreement that more
disciplinary program opportunities would be a benefit to this growing sector of the Westbury student
population. The core group of physics faculty has already attracted a significant cohort of physics minors,
most of whom attested that they would have pursued a physics major if it were to have been available to
them. Concrete program enrollment targets are identified in the proposal, and these are reasonably grounded
in national AIP statistics on the size of physics majors at comparable institutions, and in the context of
enrollment sizes and trends at Old Westbury. The proposal aims for the physics program to reach
approximately 7 graduates per year by year 5. In my view, this is a moderately aggressive but not infeasible
target. If the program successfully grows at this rate or faster within this five-year time frame, additional
faculty (1 full time & several adjunct) will become necessary at about year 3. As the proposal has identified,
a slower growth rate that does not meet the enrollment targets would still result in a viable program, and could
be feasible to run at current staffing levels.
I did speak with Professors Lippert, Estes, and Kavic about student recruiting goals and plans. Since many
Old Westbury students decide on majors after taking foundational coursework in their first year, it will be
particularly crucial to attract physics majors through an inclusive and highly engaging introductory physics
sequence. Fortunately, this framework already appears to be in place, with most of the current minors
attracted into physics through an unexpected enjoyment of an introductory physics class. In addition, the
physics faculty discussed a plan to reach out to local high school physics classes, and to widely advertise
research and course opportunities to Westbury students. In my experience, these faculty-led outreach efforts
can require a good deal of energy and organization, but they can definitely be productive if targeted toward
schools, teachers, and student groups who have already proven to be likely to be interested in STEM
opportunities at Old Westbury.

10

10. What are the prospects that recruitment efforts and admissions criteria will supply a sufficient pool of highly
qualified applicants and enrollees?
I am optimistic that a sufficient pool of students will be interested in the new physics program and will enroll.
Of course, the year-by-year enrollment numbers are hard to predict with certainty, but I think all the pieces
are in place for a successful roll-out and for a sustainable period of program growth. The program start-up
appears to be planned in a way that it will be able to adjust to somewhat slower or somewhat faster growth
than projected.

11. Comment on provisions for encouraging participation of persons from underrepresented groups. Is there
adequate attention to the needs of part-time, minority, or disadvantaged students?
As an institution, SUNY Old Westbury is highly invested in providing outstanding educational opportunities
to underrepresented minority groups (URM). This is not just a talking point -- more than 50% of Old
Westbury students meet URM criteria, including nearly 60% of students in existing STEM majors. My
interviews with physics faculty and college administrators clearly indicated that they are attuned to providing
careful consideration and attention to support the success of these students. As a discipline, physics has one
of the lowest rates of URM participation nationally (~13% of Physics B.S. degrees), so this new program
therefore has great potential to make an important impact in this critical area.
12. Assess the system for monitoring students’ progress and performance and for advising students regarding
academic and career matters.
Full-time physics faculty members will serve as primary academic advisers for each of the declared physics
majors. Faculty advisers will mentor students with respect to course selection, program progress, research
opportunities, and career planning. New and at-risk students will also receive supplementary support (e.g.
tutoring, coaching, career planning services) through the new Student Success Center and through the
Academic Advising Center.
13. Discuss prospects for graduates’ post-completion success, whether employment, job advancement, future
study, or other outcomes related to the program’s goals.
The proposal is attentive to career paths and employment opportunities for B.S. physics graduates. The
degree concentrations help focus student coursework toward a variety of highly-marketable skillsets.
Students who complete this B.S. degree will have excellent career prospects. The proposal authors rightly
point out that large private sector firms, small businesses, and academic institutions all recognize the relative
scarcity of URM physics graduates and employees, and are therefore eager to hire well-qualified URM
physics graduates.

IV. Resources
14. Comment on the adequacy of physical resources and facilities, e.g., library, computer, and laboratory
facilities; practica and internship sites or other experiential learning opportunities, such as co-ops or service
learning; and support services for the program, including use of resources outside the institution.

11

Although I was not able to visit in person due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, I was provided with a
detailed overview of current and projected facilities available for the program and I had good discussions
about facilities with students, faculty, dean, and provost. Current classrooms, and laboratory spaces, and
equipment is adequate to support the first few years of the proposed physics program. Existing library and
computational resources are also sufficient for program needs. Some investment in additional lab equipment
will be necessary for the new upper-level lab courses (Electronics and Experimental Physics Lab), and some
budget should be dedicated to maintenance and renewal of existing lab equipment.
There appears to be considerable excitement about a major renovation that is planned for the Natural Science
building on campus. The physics program will clearly benefit from plans for a state-of-the-art “SCALE-UP”
classroom which will be designed to facilitate studio-style integration of lecture and laboratory physics.
Several spaces for student use have also been designed into the renovation; these spaces promise to promote
student community and help provide a comfortable campus ‘home’ for commuter students. The exact timing
and phasing of this renovation is still to be determined but is likely to be complete in a ~3-5 year time frame.
During construction phases, temporary class and lab facilities will be provided, but administrators and faculty
expressed confidence that these will be adequate to support the program during the renovation. When the
renovation is completed, the new space should buttress the growth of the program, helping to making it a
highly functional and desirable place to study.

15. What is the institution's commitment to the program as demonstrated by the operating budget, faculty
salaries, the number of faculty lines relative to student numbers and workload, and discussions about
administrative support with faculty and administrators?
Based on my interviews, there is strong and widespread institutional and administrative support for the new
physics program. The scaled roll-out of the new program is designed such that it will not generate major new
costs in the short term. As the program demonstrates growth, the proposal calls for a moderate investment in
new lab equipment at year three, and one additional tenure-track faculty member at year 4. These requests are
commensurate with the projected growth of student majors. If the initial growth rate is slower than projected,
the investment in a new faculty line could be delayed. This proposed gradual approach appears to present low
risk to the institution, and is supported by faculty, department chairs, dean, and provost.

V. Summary Comments and Additional Observations
16. Summarize the major strengths and weaknesses of the program as proposed with particular attention to
feasibility of implementation and appropriateness of objectives for the degree offered.
This evaluation report is provided in consideration of a proposal for a new B.S. physics program at SUNY
Old Westbury. Overall, in my view, this is an excellent and carefully-considered program proposal that is
likely to succeed as described.
Strengths:
1. Innovative structure: As proposed, the new physics program would offer a rigorous and inclusive
B.S. degree with 4 degree concentrations. The concentration structure is a distinctive strength,
providing interdisciplinary breadth and unique career pathways that should prove attractive to
potential degree candidates.
2. Design for scaled growth: The proposed gradual roll-out of the new program is calibrated to avoid
unnecessary costs or risks to the institution. The proposal makes a convincing case that existing
12

resources and infrastructure are sufficient to start the program on a good path, and that moderate
investments at years 3-5 can be made in sync with the actual growth of the program.
3. Excellent core physics faculty and supporting programs: Based on my interviews with faculty and
students, and my review of faculty CVs, I was sincerely impressed with the research and teaching of
the faculty who will be central to growth and success of the new program. The existing physics
minors genuinely like the faculty members, and they are excited by opportunities to participate in
cutting-edge research and they appreciate the student-centered, well-taught physics classes.
4. Institutional support: In my discussions and interviews, chairs and faculty from affiliated programs
(Chemistry, Biology, Math & CS, Business) provided strong endorsements and support for the
proposal, and they appear to be eager to participate in the innovative interdisciplinary concentrations.
Dean Frisken and Provost Quarless also expressed enthusiasm for the proposed program, and
demonstrate a clear sense of the supports needed for the new program to thrive.
Weaknesses:
1. Enrollment uncertainty: The projected enrollment is subject to considerable uncertainty, especially
given the volatile collegiate enrollment environment associated with the Covid-19 pandemic. I think
that both of these potential concerns would be true of most new programs, and in this case are
addressed successfully by limiting the need for investments until growing enrollments are
demonstrated.
2. Lack of physics teaching concentration: At first, the omission of a physics teaching concentration
looks like a potential missed opportunity. In talking to faculty and administrators, it seems clear that
they recognize this as a potential area for growth once the program is successfully established. Given
the additional requirements for accreditation and certification of new teacher preparation programs, it
does make good sense to revisit this growth opportunity in several years.
Program Feasibility and Appropriate Objectives:
In my view, the proposal lays out a compelling and well-crafted B.S. program in physics. Careful
attention has been paid to ensuring that a rigorous and inclusive curriculum can be offered to students
in a manner that makes it feasible for students to complete, and also feasible for faculty and the
institution to offer. Objectives for student learning outcomes and career preparation are excellent and
fit very nicely with the regional setting, institutional mission, and student population. The projections
for enrollment growth are moderately aggressive, but I think they have a solid chance of being
realized, and a sound plan is in place for how to adapt if growth is somewhat slower than expected.

17. If applicable, particularly for graduate programs, comment on the ways that this program will make a unique
contribution to the field, and its likelihood of achieving State, regional and/or national prominence.
The proposed program would not offer graduate degrees. Nevertheless, the new physics program would offer
several highly distinctive contributions:
•

The Quantitative Finance concentration would be very unique for a B.S. Physics program, and is
nicely aligned with excellent regional career opportunities as well as expertise of faculty at Old
Westbury.

•

The Health Science and Applied/Computational major concentrations are also distinctive
interdisciplinary programs that will provide unique training and career prospects for B.S. graduates.
13

•

The high fraction of URM students (60%) in STEM at SUNY Old Westbury suggests that the diverse
graduates of this new program will make a significant impact on physics as a discipline that suffers
from a long-standing lack of diversity.

18. Include any further observations important to the evaluation of this program proposal and provide any
recommendations for the proposed program.
Thank you for your consideration of my review. I am sincerely excited about the prospects for this new
program and SUNY Old Westbury, and I look forward to following its progress. Please don’t hesitate to

Version 201-08-02

The External Evaluation Report is an important component of a new academic program proposal. The external
evaluator’s task is to examine the program proposal and related materials, visit the campus to discuss the proposal
with faculty and review related instructional resources and facilities, respond to the questions in this Report form,
and submit to the institution a signed report that speaks to the quality of, and need for, the proposed program. The
report should aim for completeness, accuracy and objectivity.
The institution is expected to review each External Evaluation Report it receives, prepare a single institutional
response to all reports, and, as appropriate, make changes to its program proposal and plan. Each separate
External Evaluation Report and the Institutional Response become part of the full program proposal that the
institution submits to SUNY for approval. If an external evaluation of the proposed program is required by the
New York State Education Department (SED), SUNY includes the External Evaluation Reports and Institutional
Response in the full proposal that it submits to SED for registration.

I. Program
1. Assess the program’s purpose, structure, and requirements as well as formal mechanisms for program
administration and evaluation. Address the program’s academic rigor and intellectual coherence.
The degree program that has been proposed in most ways aligns with Physics major programs at similar schools
across the country. Physics is the most fundamental of the sciences and as such fills an important role in any
comprehensive school of sciences. Students studying physics are prepared not only to pursue research in physics
and engineering, but to parlay their analytical and quantitative skills to other related fields.
The proposed program follows a familiar structure: students are expected to take foundational physics and
mathematics courses first (e.g. Physics I, II, III, and Calculus I, II, and III, often in co-requisite pairs) and then
certain standard upper-level undergraduate courses (at least Mechanics, Electricity & Magnetism,
Thermodynamics, and Quantum Mechanics). Besides those, students in most programs take other major cognates
as dictated by their interests or their particular track. That standard structure is reflected in the current proposal
and I would expect students following the proposed course layout would leave the program well prepared
compared to physics majors at similar institutions.
The proposed degree program requirements are in line with the College’s normal admission standards, which is
identical to the requirements of their sister-to-be program, Chemistry. As it is generally expected that students
taking the first introductory course in the physics sequence, Physics I, be at least co-enrolled in a Calculus I
course, it may be worth exploring the possibility of putting in place a requirement that students be eligible to take
Calculus I before declaring a Physics major. I understand that there has been some problems with students in
introductory Chemistry courses whose math background is too weak at the time they take the course, and this may
become a problem for students in introductory Physics courses as well. However, I was encouraged to learn that
students can, with careful advising, potentially graduate in four years even if they have to spend their first year
taking classes to catch up on math requirements.
2. Comment on the special focus of this program, if any, as it relates to the discipline.
The most unique and interesting aspect of the proposed physics program, which I feel would make it distinct from
many physics programs not just in the region but across the country, is the proposed concentrations. The General
Physics and Applied/Computational concentrations are typical for most physics programs that wish to prepare
their students for graduate studies or jobs in industry. The Health Science and Quantitative Finance
concentrations, while perhaps not unique, are certainly uncommon among physics programs.
Although Heath Science is a very popular discipline at many schools now, it is rarely taught with an emphasis on
physics. Health Science concentrations within Physics programs are quite rare. They give students the
opportunity to prepare for careers in medical imaging, nuclear medicine, and other medical disciplines. This kind
of preparation is becoming more important as the medical field is becoming more technical and computerized. It
is worth noting as well that Physics majors have high rates of acceptance to medical schools and tend to score
high on the MCAT exam relative to other majors, including Biology. I know of few physics programs that cater
to students interested in medicine with a program concentration.
The Quantitative Finance concentration is also rare among traditional Physics programs. For the past few
decades, Wall Street has been keen to recruit physics students to make use of their quantitative skills, especially
students with experience in numerical modeling and simulation of chaotic systems. Physics majors also find
success in finance and economics graduate programs. Creating a degree concentration that specifically prepares
physics students for careers in finance and economics is a good tactic both for recruiting potential students and for
ensuring student success after graduation, particularly for a school so close to Manhattan.

3. Comment on the plans and expectations for self-assessment and continuous improvement.
SUNY Old Westbury has an existing assessment structure involving annual self-assessment and an additional
thorough review including an external reviewer once every five years. Annual self-assessment involves a
“closing the loop” component in which the program is expected to evaluate its progress in meeting goals it set for
itself based on the previous year review. The five year review cycle offers the opportunity to evaluate long-term
goals and program needs as well as to gather input from an external evaluator. Given that women and minorities
are often underrepresented in the physical sciences, I would recommend that the program regularly assess their
recruitment efforts and success in maintaining a diverse population of majors.
4. Discuss the relationship of this program to other programs of the institution and collaboration with other
institutions, and assess available support from related programs.
Physics is traditionally intertwined with, at the least, Mathematics. Traditional Physics majors typically need to
take about five courses in mathematics (Calculus I, II, III; Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra). In
Chemistry, Physics majors typically take two semesters of Chemistry, and that is reflected in this course proposal.
Those students in the Health Science concentration take fewer math courses in exchange for more chemistry
courses, which seems like a logical plan for students in that concentration.
The Applied/Computational, Health Sciences, and Quantitative Finance concentrations all rely to some degree on
Physics students taking courses in other programs. From my conversations with the chairs of those departments, I
am confident that there will be sufficient enrollment availability for the expected number of physics students
needed those courses. I am also pleased that those program chairs are very supportive of the proposed Physics
program and these concentrations. When I spoke to them, I was pleased to hear that they did not believe that they
would lose their own majors to the new Physics program, but they expected Physics to draw in a new pool of
students.
The program faculty have already laid the groundwork for exploring possibilities for collaboration with other
schools, labs, and institutes. This will likely be a useful resource as their program grows and their students seek
research opportunities in addition to those made available by working with program faculty. I would highly
recommend the Physics faculty to continue to pursue such partnerships.
5. What is the evidence of need and demand for the program locally, in the State, and in the field at large?
What is the extent of occupational demand for graduates? What is the evidence that demand will continue?
As noted in the program proposal, over the past 20 years, the number of physics degrees awarded has
approximately doubled, while the number of physics degree programs has remained constant. Within a year of
graduating, 47% of physics majors are in graduate programs of one kind or another, and 48% are employed,
mostly in the private sector. Employers in many majors seek physics majors for their unique quantitative problem
solving skills. These employment trends are extremely encouraging for prospective physics students. In addition,
there has been a persistent need for physics educators at the high school level for the past few decades at least. I
would accordingly encourage a new Physics program to work on developing a Physics Education track in
cooperation with their college’s Education program.

II. Faculty
6. Evaluate the faculty, individually and collectively, with regard to training, experience, research and
publication, professional service, and recognition in the field.
I have met with Michael Colaneri, Michael Kavic, Matthew Lippert, Fernando Espinoza, and John Estes. Each of
them is an excellent physicist, scholar, and teacher in their own right. Each is fully dedicated and each brings an
important set of skills and qualifications to the proposed new Physics program. Equally important is their sense
of collegiality and cooperation, which is evident in their proposal as well as the conversations I had with both
them and students. They have already made impressive efforts to involve students in impressive scholarly
activities, despite not having a pool of physics majors from which to draw.
I am confident that that the faculty involved will not only be able to teach all of the courses required in a Physics
major program, but will be able to offer a variety of research opportunities to their students. I have no doubt in
their ability and drive to prepare students for graduate school, industry, health professions, or the financial world.
7. Assess the faculty in terms of number and qualifications and plans for future staffing. Evaluate faculty
responsibilities for the proposed program, taking into account their other institutional and programmatic
commitments. Evaluate faculty activity in generating funds for research, training, facilities, equipment, etc.
Discuss any critical gaps and plans for addressing them.
The current number of faculty is appropriate for the expected scale of the program while it is in its infancy. They
have already demonstrated an impressive knowledge of current and potential funding sources and have begun
making connections that will aid the proposed program both in terms of funding and professional connections in
the near future. Central to their proposal, however, is the need for faculty support as the program grows.
As I understand it, this proposal includes the need for funding for an adjunct position in its second year, and then
a new tenure-track faculty line once the program has become more established with a full body of students in its
fourth year. This additional line will be important for the proposed program in order for it to support and train its
students. Not only will the additional line be required to support the program’s teaching efforts, but to provide the
quantity and variety of opportunities for research that will be needed by its students. I would strongly encourage
the College to grant this position by the proposed program’s fourth year.
8. Evaluate credentials and involvement of adjunct faculty and support personnel.
There are presently three adjunct faculty teaching the laboratory components of introductory physics courses. I
expect this will remain necessary as the program grows. Eventually, as current faculty, who presently teach all
introductory lecture sections, are required to teach upper division courses, the number of adjunct faculty will have
to increase by one or two to cover introductory courses. Eventually, I presume, the number of adjuncts will
decrease when a new full-time tenure-track position is in place. Should the need for adjunct faculty increase, I am
confident that the need could be met given the market for qualified educators in the area of Old Westbury.

III. Students
9. Comment on the student population the program seeks to serve, and assess plans and projections for
student recruitment and enrollment.
On the surface, Physics programs exist to serve students whose interest lies in studying the fundamental
mechanisms by which the universe works. Some students are attracted to physics because of the other avenues of
study which physics allows them to explore. The proposed program blazes paths for students into the fields of
finance, medicine, computation, laboratory science, and many other fields through their proposed concentrations.
It will also help with retention. I was told that one of the main reasons students leave Old Westbury is to pursue
degree programs elsewhere that are not offered there. The new Physics program will serve as a tool for student
retention by providing more avenues of students who are undecided in what they want to study or who decide to
change their focus after they arrive at College.
SUNY College at Old Westbury has made it part of its core mission to educate traditionally underserved
communities. Over half of its population identifies as African American or Hispanic/Latino. The proposed
Physics program is designed with service to these students in mind. This is especially important because those
populations are typically underrepresented in the hard sciences.
The faculty and administration I have spoken with are not only dedicated to drawing on a diverse student
population for the proposed program but have demonstrated planning and forethought into how to do so. These
plans include use of internal programs and outreach to the community. The CSTEP program is an invaluable
resource in this regard and I am pleased that the faculty have thought about how best to use it to their advantage in
recruiting and supporting the work of underrepresented populations in Physics.
The current proposal includes a projection for student enrollment that I believe is achievable and sustainable. The
numbers are in line with schools of similar size and student population. It is worth noting that, in traditionally
small programs such as Physics, variance in enrollment can lead to years where the number of physics majors is
small, sometimes for a couple of years in a row. However, as pointed out to my by Provost Duncan Quarless, one
of the strengths of the proposed concentrations is the potential to draw students from other majors such as
Business and Mathematics into upper level courses in the proposed Physics program, thus supporting class size
numbers beyond the number of physics majors.
10. What are the prospects that recruitment efforts and admissions criteria will supply a sufficient pool of highly
qualified applicants and enrollees?
I do not believe SUNY College at Old Westbury will have any trouble meeting the proposed enrollment
projections, especially given the attractiveness of the proposed concentrations, location of the institution, and
opportunities for internal support. The College has seen impressive growth over the past decade, and the rate of
growth in STEM majors is much larger than that of the College’s average. Despite that, there are currently only a
few program offerings in STEM.
The proposed program faculty are enthusiastic about engaging in outreach in the local community and beyond,
which will be important for recruitment. In my conversations with them and from what I can tell from the
students with whom I interacted, the student population is dedicated to their work and on the whole very talented.
The faculty have been taking advantage of this by involving students in interesting and engaging research projects
already, which will also be a benefit to future recruitment efforts. Their impressive pool of Physics minors is a
testament to the promise of their recruiting efforts, which I expect will complement the wider efforts undertaken
by the College’s Office of Public and Media Relations.
11. Comment on provisions for encouraging participation of persons from underrepresented groups. Is there
5 of 10
20

adequate attention to the needs of part-time, minority, or disadvantaged students?
As mentioned previously, SUNY College at Cold Westbury has as part of its guiding doctrine a mission to recruit
and serve underrepresented groups. The diversity of its student body is a testament to that mission. The current
program is designed to serve these populations specifically, for instance through strategic use of the CSTEP
program. The current faculty have been and intent to continue to utilize CSTEP for recruitment, support for
summer student involvement, research, and mentorship. The program is also being designed with the goal in
mind of becoming a pipeline of well-trained, talented students from underrepresented populations to several
sectors of industry which are eager to support a more diverse workforce.
12. Assess the system for monitoring students’ progress and performance and for advising students regarding
academic and career matters.
The faculty take advising students very seriously, which is encouraging as this is an often overlooked aspect in the
design of new academic programs. Students across concentrations within Physics take a common set of core
courses in their first years. Careful advising after that point will allow students to choose a concentration based
on their interests and ability. The requirement that all students in the proposed major will have to complete a
capstone research project will also keep students in regular contact with faculty. I would advise the faculty to
carefully assess the progress of each of their students by the end of their first year and in regular semesterly
intervals, both to guide their progress and to catch students early on who may not be able to complete upper level
course requirements.
13. Discuss prospects for graduates’ post-completion success, whether employment, job advancement, future
study, or other outcomes related to the program’s goals.
Successful Physics majors are highly employable, and as mentioned earlier in this report in section 5, an overall
95% of physics majors are in graduate programs or are employed within one year of graduation. Given the talent
and ambition of the proposed program faculty, I am confident in the quality of education and resulting knowledge
and technical skill of this program’s future graduates. Given national statistics for well-trained physics students,
along with the proposed concentrations, a diverse student population, and the advantages of Old Westbury’s
geographic location, I have no doubt that the future graduates of this program will be employable and successful.

IV. Resources
14. Comment on the adequacy of physical resources and facilities, e.g., library, computer, and laboratory
facilities; practical and internship sites or other experiential learning opportunities, such as co-ops or service
learning; and support services for the program, including use of resources outside the institution.
As I understand it, there is a plan in place to refurbish an old science building at Old Westbury into a space
designed in part for the specific use of this proposed new program. The refurbished building will include
teaching, laboratory, research, and seminar space specifically designed to cater to the unique needs of the
proposed program. The plans as shown and described to me by several people seem ideally suited to the needs of
the proposed Physics program and also account for the expected expansion in student needs and faculty research
space. The planned seminar and computing space seems impressive as well. The faculty tell me they plan on
using the space to host and engage with potential collaborators in both industry and academia, which I would
highly encourage.
The faculty came to our discussions well prepared to court nearby institutions, companies, and government
agencies in pursuit of educational and experiential partnerships for the benefit of their students. These include
research partnerships with institutions such as SUNY Stony Brook and Brookhaven National Laboratory, and
industry partnerships with financial institutions and research groups. I expect that professional relationships of
both kinds could lead to financial support for students and student-involved research.
15. What is the institution's commitment to the program as demonstrated by the operating budget, faculty
salaries, the number of faculty lines relative to student numbers and workload, and discussions about
administrative support with faculty and administrators?
The proposal has laid out a projected need for additional adjunct faculty in the first few years, and eventually a
new tenure-track position in or about its fourth year. I am confident given my conversations with administration
that the needed adjunct support would be provided and the expected need for a tenure-track line could be met
assuming the program’s enrollment goals are being met. It is worth reiterating that if the program’s enrollment
goals are met, an additional tenure-track faculty line will be critical to the continued success of the program and
its students.
In terms of support for operating budget, I understand that a significant part of the cost of buying equipment to
furnish introductory labs and research spaces will be folded into refurbishment of the science building. At the
time that I write this, the additional costs given in the current proposal include $25,000 for expanding advanced
teaching lab needs as the program ushers more students into their third and fourth year. I have advised the faculty
to investigate the probable cost for furnishing a set of advanced lab setups, as I expect it may exceed this estimate.
Scientific equipment often incurs infrequent but significant one-time costs, for instance when an expensive part
breaks in a ten-year-old piece of equipment. I was encouraged that these costs could be handled by both faculty
and administration. There seems to be good and reasonable sharing of resources at the departmental level.

V. Summary Comments and Additional Observations
16. Summarize the major strengths and weaknesses of the program as proposed with particular attention to
feasibility of implementation and appropriateness of objectives for the degree offered.
The major strengths of the proposed Physics program include the strength and ambition of its faculty, the strength
of administrative support, facilities, and attractiveness of proposed concentrations.
The program faculty not only have a track record of excellent teaching and scholarship, but in every
aspect of the design and implementation of this program have shown dedication and enthusiasm.
Equally important is a very supportive administration who, at all levels, are excited about the proposed
program and clear about what will be needed to support it, especially in its early years.
The refurbishment of an old building which will provide facilities for the proposed program is especially
encouraging for the future of the program as it has been designed with purpose-specific teaching and
research spaces.
One of the strongest aspects of the program is the proposed concentrations, which I believe will attract
both students who would be attracted to a traditional physics program as well as those looking for
something more unique in the financial or medical fields.
The potential weaknesses of the program include uncertainty in recruitment early on, the relative inflexibility of
student schedules when upper-division courses are offered biennially, and the need to create partnerships with
other institutions.
Recruitment for majors in the first few years of any new program carries with it significant inherent
uncertainty, and this can be especially problematic for programs which traditionally enroll relatively few
majors overall. However, given the planning and drive of the program faculty, I am confident that all
reasonable efforts will be made to recruit and retain students early on and in the future.
My understanding is that certain upper-division courses required for most of the concentrations within the
physics major will be offered biennially, a practice common to physics programs at medium and small
schools including my own. One problem that sometimes arises as a result is that some students, for one
reason or another, will wind up not being able to take one of these biennial courses in their normal four
year course of study. In those cases, perhaps other courses may be substituted at the discretion of the
program, the course may be taken at another school, or the student may be able to make up the course
through an independent study. The program must be prepared to deal with these cases which, while rare,
I believe will be inevitable.
Also common in physics programs in small to medium sized schools, there is great benefit in creating
research partnerships with nearby companies and institutions. Doing so effectively expands on
opportunities for students to do research, engage in internships, and connect to other bodies of students.
17. If applicable, particularly for graduate programs, comment on the ways that this program will make a unique
contribution to the field, and its likelihood of achieving State, regional and/or national prominence.
As I have mentioned previously, but cannot overstate, the Health Science and Quantitative Finance concentrations
make this program truly stand out. The program’s access and commitment to traditionally underserved
populations, thanks in no small part to Old Westbury’s mission to recruit and serve those populations, also
contributes to its uniqueness and value.

18. Include any further observations important to the evaluation of this program proposal and provide any
recommendations for the proposed program.
The strongest recommendation I can make is to emphasize recruitment early. This can be accomplished through
traditional methods such as paper and electronic mailings and visits to local high schools, but I would suggest the
faculty cultivate an engaging social media presence as well, especially on platforms popular to young people such
as Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok (use of Twitter and Facebook by teens has fallen off precipitously in recent
years, https://www.statista.com/statistics/250172/social-network-usage-of-us-teens-and-young-adults/). Beyond
that, I am encouraged that the faculty already have great ideas for how they can craft and maintain industry and
research partnerships. I strongly encourage them to pursue those partnerships wherever possible.
In summary of the recommendations I have made elsewhere in this document, I would encourage the program to
develop a Physics Education concentration after a few years once the program is operating in a steady state. I
understand that this is a complicated process and should wait for now..
I feel that my evaluation of the program in this document has been comprehensive. My overall feeling is that the
proposal for a new physics major program is very strong. I am confident that students who go through the
program will come out well trained and ready for either graduate school or the job market. The proposed program
has the potential to make a significant positive impact on SUNY College at Old Westbury, its students, and
community.

SECTION 8 - Institutional Response to External Evaluator Reports
In Spring 2021, two external evaluators evaluated SUNY Old Westbury in view of the proposal for the
Bachelor of Science in Physics, with General Physics, Health Science, Quantitative Finance, and
Applied/Computational Concentrations.
•

•

Dr. Magee is a Professor of Physics at The College of New Jersey, 2007-present. He teaches a
large variety of courses ranging from lower division courses to upper division courses, as well as
courses in independent research. Dr. Magee has an extensive publication record in peerreviewed journals in topics ranging from climatology to physics education. He has a large
amount of experience in mentoring students and attracting funding for physics education
research.
Dr. Aaronson is a Professor of Physics at Stockton University, 2018-present. Dr. Aaronson
teaches both lower and upper division physics courses and some specialty courses he designed
on sound and hearing. He has a strong publication and conference presentation record.

Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the evaluation was held remotely. Throughout the end of March and
beginning of April, the evaluators met independently with the provost, dean, faculty, the Chemistry and
Physics chair, the chairs of the Math, Biology and Business departments, as well as students currently
minoring in physics.

In Dr. Magee’s summary he comments:
In my view, the proposal lays out a compelling and well-crafted B.S. program in physics.
Careful attention has been paid to ensuring that a rigorous and inclusive curriculum can
be offered to students in a manner that makes it feasible for students to complete, and
also feasible for faculty and the institution to offer.
In Dr. Aaronson’s summary he comments:
As I have mentioned previously, but cannot overstate, the Health Science and
Quantitative Finance concentrations make this program truly stand out. The program’s
access and commitment to traditionally underserved populations, thanks in no small part
to Old Westbury’s mission to recruit and serve those populations, also contributes to its
uniqueness and value.
These views are further reflected by both authors throughout their evaluations. We concur with both
opinions; the physics major was designed to be both flexible and efficient.
Magee:
The proposed gradual roll-out of the new program is calibrated to avoid unnecessary
costs or risks to the institution. The proposal makes a convincing case that existing
resources and infrastructure are sufficient to start the program on a good path, and that
moderate investments at years 3-5 can be made in sync with the actual growth of the
program.
Giving students a choice of strong regional career paths is at the forefront of the design of the physics
program. The physics program was created with four different concentrations designed to both fill gaps
in Old Westbury’s course offerings and to take advantage of employment sectors in New York and Long
Island.
Magee:
The proposal describes a carefully-crafted plan to offer several interdisciplinary degree
concentrations in areas of physics that are particularly relevant to the interests of Old
Westbury students and faculty, and are also aligned with fields that have strong regional
career opportunities for graduates.
Aaronson:
28

The most unique and interesting aspect of the proposed physics program, which I feel
would make it distinct from many physics programs not just in the region but across the
country, is the proposed concentrations. The General Physics and
Applied/Computational concentrations are typical for most physics programs that wish to
prepare their students for graduate studies or jobs in industry. … Health Science
concentrations within Physics programs are quite rare. They give students the
opportunity to prepare for careers in medical imaging, nuclear medicine, and other
medical disciplines. This kind of preparation is becoming more important as the medical
field is becoming more technical and computerized. … For the past few decades, Wall
Street has been keen to recruit physics students to make use of their quantitative skills,
especially students with experience in numerical modeling and simulation of chaotic
systems. … Creating a degree concentration that specifically prepares physics students
for careers in finance and economics is a good tactic both for recruiting potential
students and for ensuring student success after graduation, particularly for a school so
close to Manhattan.
The program addresses needs at the university, state and national levels.
Aaronson:
The College has seen impressive growth over the past decade, and the rate of growth in
STEM majors is much larger than that of the College’s average. Despite that, there are
currently only a few program offerings in STEM.
Magee:
As mentioned above, the proposed concentrations in Health Sciences and Quantitative
Finance are particularly unique designs that are well-attuned to regional job
opportunities on Long Island and in New York City.
Magee:
As an institution, SUNY Old Westbury is highly invested in providing outstanding
educational opportunities to underrepresented minority groups (URM). This is not just a
talking point -- more than 50% of Old Westbury students meet URM criteria, including
nearly 60% of students in existing STEM majors. My interviews with physics faculty and
college administrators clearly indicated that they are attuned to providing careful
consideration and attention to support the success of these students. As a discipline,
physics has one of the lowest rates of URM participation nationally (~13% of Physics
B.S. degrees), so this new program therefore has great potential to make an important
impact in this critical area.
Both evaluators mention the lack of a physics teaching concentration as a drawback. Once the Physics
program is running, we intend to work with Old Westbury’s School of Education to develop a physics
29

education program. This was communicated to the evaluators during the evaluation.
Magee:
At first, the omission of a physics teaching concentration looks like a potential missed
opportunity. In talking to faculty and administrators, it seems clear that they recognize
this as a potential area for growth once the program is successfully established. Given
the additional requirements for accreditation and certification of new teacher
preparation programs, it does make good sense to revisit this growth opportunity in
several years.
Another possible weakness they identify is student recruitment. Enrollment in physics programs for
schools our size has a large variation nationwide. We have taken steps to account for both
undershooting and overshooting our enrollment targets. This is recognized by both evaluators.
Magee:
The projected enrollment is subject to considerable uncertainty, especially given the
volatile collegiate enrollment environment associated with the Covid-19 pandemic. I
think that both of these potential concerns would be true of most new programs, and in
this case are addressed successfully by limiting the need for investments until growing
enrollments are demonstrated.
Aaronson:
Recruitment for majors in the first few years of any new program carries with it
significant inherent uncertainty, and this can be especially problematic for programs
which traditionally enroll relatively few majors overall. However, given the planning and
drive of the program faculty, I am confident that all reasonable efforts will be made to
recruit and retain students early on and in the future.
Both evaluations expressed views that current facilities would be able to support the physics
program, with the only concerns stemming from large growth in enrollment and development of
the new upper division laboratory course.
Magee:
The chemistry and physics department currently shares administrative and lab support
personnel. This current arrangement should continue to function adequately in the short-tomedium term. If the program grows to the extent that 10+ graduates are completing the program
each year and one or two new full-time faculty are needed, then an additional support person or
adjusted administrative structure may need to be considered.
Aaronson:
At the time that I write this, the additional costs given in the current proposal include $25,000
for expanding advanced teaching lab needs as the program ushers more students into their third
30

and fourth year. I have advised the faculty to investigate the probable cost for furnishing a set of
advanced lab setups, as I expect it may exceed this estimate.
SUNY Old Westbury has already accommodated a large constant growth in student enrollment in the
physical and life sciences over the past ten years. If this growth continues, an additional laboratory
technician specializing in physics will eventually be hired. We have also considered Dr. Aaronson’s
comment regarding the cost of the upper division labs and performed a more detailed cost analysis. The
proposal includes an updated cost, implemented in a way that the additional cost is contingent on
enrollment targets being met.
In summary, as per our external evaluators, the structure and design of the program are well-crafted and
the curricular structure is in accord with other physics programs around the nation. Physics is a core
science program and the strong growth in STEM enrollment demands the establishment of such a
program at Old Westbury. Given the lack of diversity in physics at a national level and the strong
diversity of Old Westbury, there is no reason why Old Westbury should be one of the very few
comprehensive campuses in SUNY without a physics program.
