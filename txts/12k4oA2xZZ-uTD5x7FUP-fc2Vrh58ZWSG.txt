CAP Proposal Statement: Minor in Community Action Psychology
1. Minor: Community Action Psychology
Housing Department: Psychology
2. Purpose: Community Action Psychology is an interdisciplinary minor offered by the
Psychology Department that equips students to promote individual and community wellbeing through action and research. Through courses that emphasize lived experience in
an ecological context, analyze the causes and consequences of social inequality,
explore social change efforts, and apply theories and evidence to real world social
issues, the curriculum provides foundational knowledge and skills to build more
equitable and just community-based settings, programs, and policies.
The goal of the Community Action Psychology minor is to expand pathways and
preparation for students interested in pursuing careers in promoting individual wellbeing, empowerment, and mental health within community-based settings. Students will
learn how to apply research to analyze and address social problems at multiple levels of
analysis in a broad range of settings. This minor expands options for students who are
interested in a community-based approach to mental health and well-being, while
supporting the Department’s and the College’s missions to promote social justice and
equip students to become agents of social change.
This minor provides valuable preparation for students interested in pursuing careers in
nonprofit leadership, program management, program planning, evaluation and
assessment, policy development, advocacy, consultation, health and human services,
community-engaged research, human resources, education settings, and corporate
settings dealing with community affairs and outreach.
3. Demand: The Community Action Psychology minor expands the College’s current
offerings by emphasizing research with a focus on mental health and individual wellbeing. It also makes a unique contribution to the Department by having a more applied
and less individualistic focus than the current tracks in Psychology. This fills a gap in
between these areas, as it were, and expands what we offer to students and the types of
careers to which they are exposed. We believe there will be a strong demand for this
minor.
4. Curriculum: All courses included in the minor are existing courses, but assembled in a
manner to support four different domains: foundations, social inequality, social change,
and an applied learning capstone. New courses that were just developed for the
psychology major’s Social Psychology domain (Peace, Violence, & Conflict Resolution;
Prevention, Promotion, & Program Evaluation; Peer Support & Community Mental
Health) and Diversity & Social Justice domain (Psychology of Socioeconomic Inequality;
Psychology of Ethnicity; Sexual Identities & LGBTQ+ Psychology) are also included in
this minor.

5. Instruction: Courses for the minor are taught by the following full-time faculty members:
a. Psychology: Drs. Sarah Kamens, Melissa Kiner, Ashlee Lien, Erin Toolis, & Lisa
Whitten & contingent faculty
b. Politics, Economics & Law: Dr. Carolyn Cocca & contingent faculty
c. Professional Studies: Contingent faculty members
d. Public Health: Drs. Rahwa Haile, Chris Hartmann, Martha Livingston, & Sarah
Smith
e. Sociology: Drs. Jillian Crocker, Keisha Goode, Laura Limonic, Diana
Papademas, Ryoko Yamamoto, Gilda Zwerman & contingent faculty
6. Resources: All courses contributed to the minor exist in the latest edition of the catalog.
It is possible that demand for courses included in the minor could increase, which would
require additional sections to be offered for certain courses.
7. Administration: The minor will be managed by the Psychology Department, with Drs.
Melissa Kiner, Ashlee Lien, Erin Toolis, and Lisa Whitten serving as faculty advisors.
