2020 PRODiG RENEWAL APPLICATION - Progress Toward Goals Report
The PRODiG Assessment and Goal Evaluation form is designed to track campus progress toward goals identified in the PRODIG plans
submitted in 2019. Information provided in this form will be reviewed and considered in decisions regarding future PRODiG funding.
As promised, we are making the process less onerous, so in the table below we are providing each campus with PRODiG plan goals as
referenced in the PRODiG plan. Column 1 has been pre-filled based on the campus PRODiG plan submissions. The campus is solely
responsible for completing Columns 2–5 with a special emphasis on the detailed action steps taken to reach each goal.
Below is a description of each Column in the table along with an explanation of required information to be added to each where relevant:
Column 1: Goal Categories
This column reflects the goals campuses articulated in their 2019 PRODiG Proposals, grouped by category (Hiring Goals, Pipeline Building
Goals, Faculty/Staff Professional Development and Outreach and Collaboration). For goals that fall outside of these four goal categories, we
added an “Additional Goals” category for campuses to add goals that do not neatly fit under the other four categories. Campuses should fill
in the relevant information.
Column 2: Specific and Detailed Action Steps toward Goal Completion
This column requires the campus to provide detailed action steps for each separately identified goal in Column 1.
Column 3: Status
This column requires the campus to provide the status towards reaching the listed goal in Column 1. Status determinations are as follows:
N= Not started, I= In-progress, C= Completed and O = Other (Provide a separate explanation if this is the case).
Column 4: % Complete
This column is based on the percentage of work completed per action step within a goal as shown in Column 1.
Column 5: Assigned to Whom?
This column is based on the individual/s that are responsible for assuring the completion and implementation of the identified goal in
Column 1. Provide name and email or office of the responsible party.

Goal: Hiring

Promote location and diversity to
attract applicants (p .5)

Use applicant tracking (Interview
Exchange) to support recruitment
(p. 9)

faculty (p. 23) such as discounted
realtor fees.
Provide information for dual
career couples (p.23)

Support on campus child care with
discounted rates (p. 23)

Detailed Action Steps toward Goal Completion
Pilot of “Process Advocate” role on Hiring Committees;
we piloted this role in all School of Business hiring
processes; goal is for the next round of faculty searches
to increase use of a Process Advocate from 18% to 50%
of faculty search processes
Fully Implemented; we regularly utilize the Interview
Exchange platform to monitor advertising success rates,
and as a source for hiring process assessment (e.g., the
data for our Step Analysis draws directly from Interview
Exchange Reports); this has enabled us to assess our
advertising effectiveness, given our constrained budget
This funding is Included as part of Initial Contracts, with
awareness of the socioeconomic impediments that
newly hired faculty may experience
(Situation has not yet presented in which this would be
applicable)
Currently planning for negotiations with campus
childcare provider; our Campus Child Care Advisory
Committee recently fell into desuetude, and we are
considering models for a new relationship with our
current provider; 2020-21 goal is to reestablish the
Child Care Advisory Committee
Pilot of “Process Advocate” role on Hiring Committees
(see above)
Training video titled "Interviewing Candidates" made
available to search committees; access is via the online
EVERFI training platform; goal is to train all faculty
involved in faculty searches in 2020-21.
