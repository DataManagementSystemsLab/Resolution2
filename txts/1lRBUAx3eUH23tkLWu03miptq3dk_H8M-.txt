RESOLUTION ON UK-SYSTEM A- AND AS-LEVEL TRANSFER CREDIT

Academic Practices and Policy Committee

December 11, 2018

WHEREAS SUNY Old Westbury strives for diversity and accessibility to students of all national and cultural backgrounds, including international students, and

WHEREAS graduates of UK-type secondary school systems (those taking A and AS-level leaving exams) living in our region and the country at large deserve the equivalency of their academic credentials to be established, and

WHEREAS these graduates also constitute a large share of potential international applicants, including those from India, Pakistan, Cameroon, Nepal, Hong Kong, Singapore, Zimbabwe, some Caribbean nations among others, and

WHEREAS UK colleges and universities have recently instituted tuition increases that make US colleges comparably more competitive for international applicants and the College may therefore anticipate an increase in applicants with such credentials, and

WHEREAS the College currently has no guidelines governing transfer credits for A or AS-level exam certificates (which are analogous to US-system Advanced Placement exams), therefore

BE IT RESOLVED that the College officially offer transfer credit to incoming students for A and AS-level exam certificates, but 

WHEREAS the intensity and appropriate transfer credit for A or AS-level certificates varies across academic subjects, and

WHEREAS it is therefore not possible to stipulate standard transfer credit value across all A or AS-level certificates, therefore

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the number of transfer credits for such certificates and whether or not they are counted towards individual majors or Liberal Education domains be determined on a case-by-case basis by the relevant academic department or the liberal education committee as appropriate, and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that such adjudications take place similarly to current transfer-credit decisions, via communication from the Registrar to the relevant department chairperson who can then confer with members of their department to reach a determination.
