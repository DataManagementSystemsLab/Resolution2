Minor in Community Health
Proposal for Minor in Community Health
A. Purpose: What knowledge and/or skills is the minor designed to confer? How will these
benefit students?
This minor will introduce students to core concepts in public health, using the social
determinants of health framework. Students will learn how the social, political and economic
environment shapes population health and about the structure of the domestic health system, and
how to apply the empirical skills of epidemiology. They will also explore a self-tailored set of
electives, possibly including environmental justice, women’s health, health policy, racism and
health, immigrant and refugee health. All existing (see below) and future Public Health electives
will satisfy the electives requirement.
B. Demand: Which students are likely to take this minor? What might it allow them to do
upon graduation?
This minor will have broad interest, in particular for students interested in pursuing the
health professions and those interested in understanding and mitigating the impact of social
inequities on populations. Students minoring in public health with the intention of pursuing allied
health professions will gain from this program, as they will be come to those professions with a
deep understanding of the larger social structures by which health is shaped. While clinical
training will enable them to understand and respond to specific biophysiological processes, their
training in the Community Health minor will allow them to understand how social structures
shape the health of individuals and populations, and the political and administrative structure of
the U.S. health care system. This will help them to advance their careers and to take on roles in
policy and administration with a critical lens. It will also help them to understand and respond to
the needs of their patients in a much more holistic and sustainable way.
Students interested in understanding the health impact of social inequities will also be
particularly interested in this minor. These students will likely already have a passion for
understanding the processes through which social inequities operate. However, this minor will
enable them to focus this passion within the domain of population health, and to empirically
understand the ways in which large-scale inequities manifest as health inequities. Further, it will
allow them to understand how to use research to better examine structural inequities and their
impacts on health through the use of epidemiological principles. This training will benefit
students in their pursuit of careers in policy, social work, law and politics.
C. Curriculum Which existing courses will be used to support the new minor? What new
courses will be developed?

All courses used to support this minor are currently existing courses and are listed by
departments in the attached proposal. No new courses will be developed at this time.
D. Instruction Who will teach the courses in the new minor (i.e., which faculty members,
from which departments)?
All Public Health faculty will teach courses in the new minor. In addition, faculty
teaching courses in other departments already approved as Public Health electives will
teach courses in this new minor.
E. Resources What existing curricular resources (facilities, equipment) will be devoted to
the new minor? What additional curricular resources might be needed before the
program can be offered?
Existing curricular resources such as University computer labs, classrooms, and software
(e.g. SPSS) will aid instruction for the new minor. Since all courses are currently
existing courses, it is not anticipated that additional curricular resources will be needed
before the program is offered. Should the demand prove substantial, additional course
sections may be needed in future years.
F. Administration Which department(s) and/or faculty member(s) will have responsibility
for advising students in the new minor?
Once a student has declared a minor in Public Health, they will meet with one of our five
full-time tenured/tenure-track faculty.
