Section 2. Program Summary
In 300 or fewer words, describe the proposed program, including its purpose, content, structure and duration.
The 48-credit Media Production: Nonfiction Audio and Video major takes a holistic approach to developing the skills
and techniques of journalistic and documentary storytelling. Students engage in nonfiction audio and video production
within a critical framework, centering on the role of media within society and as a tool for social change.
In three foundational writing/research and media studies courses, students develop critical thinking skills and explore
the role of media in society. Students also learn the basics of journalistic writing and nonfiction multimedia
production through the lens of ethical journalism practices.
Four production electives focus on researching, planning, writing, producing, and editing nonfiction audio/video
projects. In these courses, students also refine audiovisual storytelling techniques while exploring the creative process.
Two additional electives in American Society/Media Studies develop analytical skills and content specialties.
Students are encouraged to use these electives to develop a “beat,” namely a focus on specific areas of study such as
immigration, gender, and sexuality; Black or Latinx studies; and environmental studies, among others. Student media
projects will be informed by and build on these content specialties. Students will also be encouraged to pursue related
minors, micro-credentials, and linked courses to deepen content area expertise.
The required 4-credit internship builds students’ real-world experience, taking advantage of Old Westbury’s
proximity to the world’s media capital, New York City.
Capstone courses are completed in a two-semester sequence. In the first, Senior Media Project, students focus on
researching and writing a final project proposal, then producing a nonfiction audio or video project. In the second,
Senior Media Portfolio, students polish media projects for distribution, and prepare work samples to create a digital
portfolio of media work.
This degree incorporates the courses also included in three existing, “stackable” micro-credentials: Fundamentals of
Television News Production; Fundamentals of Non-Fiction Video Production; and Advanced TV/Video Production.

Optional, Illustrative Questions to Consider:
For other SUNY campuses responding to the Program Announcement
● Do you have a similar or related program? ●What has been your experience with the program? ●Would
the introduction of this program have any effect, positive or negative, on your institution? If so, please specify.
●Do you perceive a need for this kind of program? ●Does the program offer an opportunity for articulation or
inter-institutional cooperation?
Your response must be in writing, from your President, and addressed to the President of the proposing
campus, with a copy to the SUNY Provost at program.review@.suny.edu.
Procedure for Program Announcements (PA)
1. SCOPE. A SUNY campus must send a PA to the SUNY Provost at program.review@suny.edu before submitting
a proposal for a new program leading to an undergraduate degree. Unless requested by the SUNY Provost, a PA
is not required for a program leading to an undergraduate certificate, for a new program being created by
combining existing registered programs (e.g., multi-award programs and/or multi-institution programs), or for a
new program being created from a track, specialization, or concentration in a registered program.
2. SUNY PROVOST’S REVIEW. The SUNY Provost’s Office reviews each PA for accuracy and completeness as
well as for substantive issues, such as alignment with campus mission and SUNY policy, and requests changes
when needed.
3. PUBLICATION FOR COMMENTS. Once a PA is acceptable to the SUNY Provost, it is announced on the
SUNY Program Review listserv in a weekly Program Review Update, which starts a 30-day intra-SUNY
comment period. The listserv includes all campus presidents, chief academic officers, and others upon request.
The PA enables other SUNY campuses – particularly those with experience with related programs – to provide
information to the proposing campus that can be used to construct a sound program proposal.
4. COMMENTS FROM OTHER CAMPUSES. The President of each interested campus must send comments
within 30 days of a PA’s publication in the Program Review Update to the President of the proposing campus,
with a copy to the Provost at program.review@suny.edu. Comments may include advice and suggestions about
possible articulation opportunities, enrollment trends in related programs, and opportunities for cooperation, as
well as concerns or objections.
5. FOLLOWING THE COMMENT PERIOD. Once the 30-day comment period for a PA ends, and any concerns
and/or objections have been resolved, the campus may prepare a full proposal for the SUNY Provost and, when
required, begin the external evaluation process.

6. EXPIRATION. A PA expires one year after its publication in the Program Review Update. If the proposing
campus does not submit a program proposal to the SUNY Provost before a PA expires, the campus must submit
another PA to start the process again.
