Resolution on the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (OSSD)

Whereas the SUNY College at Old Westbury is required to be in compliance
with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 by providing access and
reasonable accommodation to students;

And Whereas the Faculty have been informed by their representatives that there
are conditions that place us out of compliance and raise questions about academic
issues with regard to the services received by students with disabilities;
And Whereas, The administration is planning to hire an Assistant Director of the
OSSD;

And Whereas, there is an immediate need for screen reading software and other
adaptive technologies and
And Whereas, the OSSD is currently inappropriately funded,
And Whereas, that the fundamental service of OSSD is to provide academic
support for students;
Therefore, Be It Resolved That the Faculty Senates recommends the following

prescriptions:

1) No committee be empowered to search or hire an Assistant Director of OSSD
unless the job description includes that the position requires the knowledge,
skills and abilities necessary for the provision of direct services to students;

2)

That the Administration take the necessary actions to purchase JAWs and
other adaptive technologies;

3)

That the Administration provide an appropriate and adequate budget
consistent with other student support services provided by the college be
allocated to the OSSD;

4)

And that since the function of OSSD is to provide programs of academic
support and tutoring, it should, as do the other academic support services, rest
under the administration of the Office of Academic Affairs.
