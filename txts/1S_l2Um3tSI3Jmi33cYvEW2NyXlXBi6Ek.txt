February is dedicated to educating the public about paper

recycling do's and don'ts with a bit of a Valentine's Day theme-

show paper recycling some love! According to the US EPA,
over 65% (approximately 44.2 million tons) of the paper and
paperboard produced was recycled in 2017. Let's recycle even
more in 2020 and make sure that the paper we're recycling is of
high value and free of contamination. How? Recycle paper from
your home, office, school and just make sure it is clean, dry,
and free of food residue. Recycle paper right NY!
