Overloads for students increase from taking five courses to six, which is
detrimental to learning.

Math/CIS — Decided on four credit hours.

Teacher Education Program - Students spend time in field experience and work. In the

past, moved from a three- to four-credit model to combine fieldwork with class time.
Would have to add courses, creating a problem with students graduating within a
reasonable time. The Program would have to be reorganized, since TEP is currently
registered with the state as a four-credit program.

Visual Arts — A four-credit schedule is better for working students. Studio-based courses
cannot function with reduced hours due to set-up times for materials.
