Solution
Each school should find their top students in their Junior and Senior year
and develop a way to acknowledge them: counseling by advisors that shows
how many semesters they have to graduate, job placement ideas, resume
writing, alumni or outside speakers, internships,  “Tea” with the
President.

Honors programs should be within the different Schools so that they are
more visible to all of students and share in more of a community spirit!

Use a scheduling program so that courses will be offered in all majors so
that all students can graduate in 4 – 6 years.

Adjust faculty extra service pay to teach an extra course. The compensation
should be comparable to the money earned at Hofstra, Adelphi etc.

Develop articulation programs with other SUNY institutions similar to the
joint program with NYIT. Develop a stronger articulation agreement with
other SUNY Institutions such as: Stonybrook for pre-med programs, nursing.
More joint programs.

Develop a survey for students in good standing who leave.

Focus 2
Freshmen and Sophomores

Solutions
Early warning system for Freshmen and Sophomore students who are performing
below a 2.5 average to meet with teaching faculty.
 A sophomore orientation program should be mandatory each semester by
School. This could be in Arts and Science, School of Business and School of
Education. These students should meet the faculty in their school of
interest. This could allow students to learn more about the major and the
faculty could review their transcripts to make suggestions about future
classes at Old Westbury.
