Whereas, The University Faculty Senate has long supported University-wide campus-based
assessment of General Education; and

Whereas, The SUNY System Administration has worked cooperatively with the University
Faculty Senate and the Faculty Council of Community Colleges to establish the General
Education Assessment Review (GEAR) committee to oversee the campus-based assessment
process; and

Whereas, SUNY campuses have long-established quality General Education programs and
implemented the GEAR-approved assessment plans, which Provost Salins called a “huge

success” and a “remarkable accomplishment”; and

Whereas, Each SUNY campus is unique, having different missions, admissions standards,

student populations, and means of satisfying the SUNY General Education requirements; and

Whereas, Accrediting bodies such as the Middle States Commission on Higher Education
recognize the diversity of campus programs within a state system and assess the performance of
the individual campuses and not the state-wide system; and

Whereas, National experts on assessment (e.g., Dr. Barbara Cambridge, former Director of
Assessment for the American Association of Higher Education, and Dr. Peter Ewell, Senior
Associate of the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems), and a recent

report of the Institute for Higher Education Leadership and Policy of the California State
University have argued that academic assessment is best done at the campus and not system
level; and

Whereas, Dr. Candace Young reported at the 135" Plenary Meeting of the University Faculty
Senate on the nature and success of the nationally recognized campus-based assessment program

at Truman State University; and

Whereas, The specific requirement in the draft Memorandum of Understanding on Value-Added
Assessment (September 26, 2003) for common measures across the campuses of SUNY would

undermine fundamental principles of academic excellence by discouraging pedagogical
creativity and innovation; and

Whereas, General Education occurs over a student’s entire academic career, and since students

take individually diverse pathways through the available educational programs, including
coursework at other institutions of higher education, internships, and study abroad programs,
attempting to test this diversity in the manner proposed in the draft Memorandum of
Understanding on Value-Added Assessment (September 26, 2003) is academically unwise and
unsound; and

Whereas, The costs of such a program would be considerable and would have to come from
SUNY’s zero-sum budget in an economic environment that already restricts the ability of
campuses to carry out their academic missions; and

Whereas, The June 17 Resolution on Assessment of Student Leaning Outcomes of the Board of

Trustees has offered no academically compelling reasons, evidence or problems that warrant its
approach to assessment; therefore

Be it resolved that the University Faculty Senate respectfully requests that the Board of Trustees

suspend implementation of its June 17 Resolution on Assessment of Student Learning Outcomes
in order to engage in a substantial dialog among representatives of the Provost’s Office, the
Board of Trustees, and faculty governance regarding University-wide campus-based assessment;
Be it further resolved that the University Faculty Senate cannot support the proposed
Memorandum of Understanding on Value-Added Assessment dated September 26, 2003 but

does support an ongoing discussion which will produce a mutually acceptable process of
University-wide campus-based assessment;
Be it further resolved that the University Faculty Senate reaffirms its long-standing

commitment to University-wide campus-based assessment, and will urge campuses to continue
to implement their GEAR-approved General Education assessment plans; and

Be it further resolved that in the best interests of the education of our students, and the State

University of New York, the University Faculty Senate invites the Board of Trustees and SUNY
System ‘Administration to continue to discuss the assessment of foundational skills in General
Education. This may include externally referenced measures of the campus’s choice that
provides for campus responsibility and System Administration oversight.
