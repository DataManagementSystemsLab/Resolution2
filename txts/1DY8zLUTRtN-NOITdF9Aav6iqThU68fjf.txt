Annual Report of the Senate Chair (academic year 2013-14):  submitted by Duncan Quarless, June 23, 2014 (any potential addenda for summer will be added later).  The Faculty Senate Office has not received any nominations for the chair position thus far.  Recommend that bylaws include chair (and all the other officers of the Senate – Executive Committee) in the committee election process.

Outstanding Business of the Senate from 2012-13 (undertaken in 2013-14):

There were several items from 2012-13 which required follow-up actions during this past year:

Vote on bylaws amendments (Article I and Article VI) (ballot passed ref. W. Sbaschnik, 6-6-14, for Article I, 97 yes, 3 no, 0 abs.; for Article VI, 94 yes, 3 no, 0 abs.)

Report on other potential bylaws revisions (presented to Senate, May 23, 2014 – accepted 6-3-14)

Follow-up review on Seamless Transfer implementation process (GE and transfer paths) (Final Report presented to Senate, May 23, 2014 – accepted 6-3-14)

Address faculty responsibility in terms of the culture for shared governance and the administrative responsibility for the institutional climate for shared governance (resolutions were crafted, presented and approved by Senate – 2-28-14 and 6-3-14, respectively).  There were three other related proposed items from 2012-13: post-tenure & 360 reviews, and attendance in the Senate to be included in the Chair’s annual report and reported regular to Senate.  The executive committee also felt that some type of “State of the Senate” summary for the year be reported in writing.

Continue work to improve transparency and communication in intersecting areas of governance (e.g. student life issues that impact academics – financial cancellation, food services, parking/transportation services, sexual harassment)

Feature the work of the committees of the faculty to the Senate (present annual reports) (all of the Standing Committees, Article VII, and most of the College-wide Committees, Appendix I, reported to the Senate 2013-14).  TLRC proposal was approved during 2012-13 without further action.



Actionable items – Outstanding Business of the Senate from 2013-14 (a type of “State of the Senate” summary):

With respect to item 1 from 2012-13, as this ballot has passed, the Senate must decide on the means by which electronic voting especially for committee elections will be conducted.  

With respect to item 2 from 2012-13, most of the standing and college-wide committees of the faculty reviewed their respective sections of the bylaws and made recommendations where applicable for potential bylaws’ revisions.  These committee reports were included in the bylaws report produced in 2013-14.  The bylaws report should be taken under consideration by the Faculty Rights and Responsibilities Committee during AY 2014-15 as part of a more comprehensive effort.

With respect to item 3 from 2012-13, the Seamless Transfer report included some fundamental findings on our current curricula across the campus (GE and within majors).  There are opportunities to use these findings in a proactive way.  For example:

propose transfer paths for majors where such do not currently exist 

continue our review of curricula that can become more responsive to student needs through contemporary pedagogical content revisions

continue our development of the GE program (disaggregating requirements, goals and learning outcomes: GE from institutional ones)

build on existing curricula to produce new curricula

With respect to item 4 from 2012-13, two resolutions were passed by the Senate 2013-14.  The Culture resolution subsequently prompted a couple potential actions – the proposal to develop Faculty Senate Service Awards, and a recommendation for a review of the bylaws’ provisions in prompting/compelling greater participation by tenured faculty (e.g. faculty senate exec should be a tenured group?); the Climate resolution was passed at the end of the academic year and thus needs some practical follow-up actions.  The FRR committee may want to undertake a process to operationalize post-tenure and 360 reviews (i.e. create them as sub-committees of the FRRC?).  Still attempting to organize/establish/maintain accurate attendance spreadsheet in order to include such in report.

With respect to item 5 from 2012-13, several developments were noted in 2013-14: the Presidential Task Force on Financial Cancellation (TFFC) produced a report with recommendations, most of which were adopted with a progressive implementation timetable; the Administration identified the chairs for some of its committees (e.g. food services committee); an ad hoc Sexual Harassment Committee remained intact.  There are ongoing concerns here: some follow-up with the ad hoc committees of the Senate may be in order (i.e. branding, and sexual harassment); the President’s implementation timetable (financial cancellation) remains opaque – the TFFC which remained intact by request of the President has been unsuccessful in acquiring status updates; there is some unfinished business with respect to crafting/establishing policy (i.e. Anti-Fraternization and Consensual Sexual Relationship Policy); the Senate should not lose sight of the ongoing “branding” process. 

With respect to item 6 from 2012-13, the Senate experienced some positive momentum in terms of committee reporting: a means to improve the transparency of committee operations, to provide greater support for continuity and progress in committee activities year-to-year, to improve active participation by committees in relationship to the decision-making activities of the Senate, and to cultivate mentorship/leadership in governance.  It is recommended that the Senate support these efforts in order to both gauge and advance its progress in governance.  Any annual committee reports submitted for this year will be sent to the newly elected committee chairs early in the fall 2014.  Based upon committee annual reports, consider any outstanding item(s) in this regard from 2012-13, 2013-14. 

Secretary/Treasurer’s Report: 

Executive Committee had some difficulty deciding on an appropriate template for reporting meeting minutes.  Will make a recommendation about this before the end of summer 2014.

Old Westbury Faculty Fund had an opening balance (as of 9-30-13 statement) of  $1,396.81 ($308.15 checking, $1,088.66 saving), $77.85 was withdrawn for costs associated with posthumous Citation to honor Nelson Mandela, closing balance (as of 5-31-14 statement) of $1,321.23.  It is unclear what purpose the fund serves and has been dormant for the most part beyond compounding interest for several years.  



Open/Pending Items ending the year (for early consideration by the Senate in fall 2014):

Schedule Change (Senate passed a resolution at the end of the year which calls for establishing a joint task force which will produce a report including recommendations prior to the end of the fall 2014 semester) (Will discuss this with the Provost early summer). 

Residency Requirement (Provost announced that the administration is considering a potential change in the residency requirement which will affect all of our degree programs) (Will discuss this with the Provost early summer).

Seamless Transfer Implementation for General Education (implementation of agreed GE program/bulletin changes) (Will discuss this with Provost early summer).

CAP – PA (BS Environmental Science) (Will discuss this with Provost early summer).

Consultation in the area of  institutional budgeting:  

RABPC sub-group (faculty and professionals) met May 29, 2014 and a potential summer follow-up full committee meeting may be scheduled (Will discuss this with Provost early summer).

Financial Cancellation Task Force operation (Will revisit with Administration early summer).

Develop review criteria for leadership in governance: i.e. Senate Chair, President, Executive Committee.

Resolution on Inclusion of Social Justice Component in Majors (Senate agreed to offer a modified resolution in 2014-15, need follow-up on this in the fall 2014).
