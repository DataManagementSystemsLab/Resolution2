Structure

The Board of Trustees set up Faculty governance under Article X to enable the faculty to deliberate and make policies 

Faculty senate is the overall structure to legislative body

There also standing committees (elected by faculty), special committees, college-wide committees, Presidential committees, and ad hoc committees,
