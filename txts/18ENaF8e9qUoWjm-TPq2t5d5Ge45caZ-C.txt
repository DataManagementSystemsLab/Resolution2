COLD WAR LONG
ISLAND
The Cold War had a big impact on Long Island. Lake Success was the original
home for the UN—where Cold War conflict between the U.S. and the Soviet Union
played out. Bases to launch nuclear-tipped missiles to detonate amid formations
of Soviet bombers feared heading to New York City were set up. Fall-out shelters
were built and “duck and cover” drills held in schools.

AN AMERICAN SICKNESS:
A CLOSER LOOK INTO THE
AMERICAN HEALTHCARE
SYSTEM
The healthcare sector, now representing more than one-sixth of the U.S. economy in
terms of economic activity, continues to change in unimaginable ways. This lecture will
first take the pulse of the US health care sector and make international comparisons.
In the seconds part we will discuss how economists think about the trends that are
developing within this sector – with the emphasis on the hospitals, big pharma, and
health insurance industry and try to explain, why the healthcare costs keep on going
up.
