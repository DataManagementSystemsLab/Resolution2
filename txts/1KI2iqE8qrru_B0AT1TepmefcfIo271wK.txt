Distinguished Service Professor

Resolution Two:

Whereas the distinguished service professorship is the highest rank in SUNY honoring faculty

Whereas faculty governance is one of the most important aspects of an academic enterprise ~
dedicated to the ideal of collegiality; and
Whereas there is no explicit language in the DSP guidelines indicating that service in faculty
