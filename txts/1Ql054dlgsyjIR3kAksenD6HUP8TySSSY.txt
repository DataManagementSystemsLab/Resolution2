Resolution: Policy Regarding Reinstatement Procedure



Whereas students have two choices in how to respond to a suspension or dismissal: observe the time periods in which they must sit out the semester (one semester for suspension, two semesters for dismissal), or appeal the decision and attend a hearing with the Academic Standing Committee; and



Whereas current procedure, as currently written in the college policy, requires the registrar to contact the members of the Academic Policies and Practices Committee (APPC) to get permission for a student who observed the time period suspension or dismissal to be reinstated; and 



Whereas this procedure unnecessarily delays the registration of students returning from suspension or dismissal; 



Be it resolved that the registrar no longer needs to have permission from APPC to reinstate a student who chose not to appeal the initial Deanâ€™s Office decision, and who observed their suspension or dismissal.
