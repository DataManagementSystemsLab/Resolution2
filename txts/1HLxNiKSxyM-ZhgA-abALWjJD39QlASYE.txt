RATIONALE:
WHEREAS ​the SUNY Board of Trustees September 10, 2015 Resolution “Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion Policy” desires to make “SUNY the most inclusive higher education system in the country,”
and states within the Guiding Principles that “SUNY’s statutory mission makes clear its responsibility
to provide the broadest possible access, fully representative of all segments of the population of New
York State”; and
WHEREAS ​consistent with that commitment, the UFS Committee on Equity, Inclusion and Diversity is
charged to “concern itself with issues pertaining to equity, inclusiveness and access, as they are
reflected in the curriculum, student body and personnel of the State University”; and
WHEREAS​ the
​
recent killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd and many others
by police have once again highlighted racial inequities in policing and the criminal justice system in the
United States, and the COVID-19 pandemic has affected BIPOC (Black, indigenous, and people of
color) communities in disproportionate rates, demonstrating the racial inequities in our health care and
education systems; and
WHEREAS ​in a nation that has for centuries struggled with issues of racial inequity and injustice, and
because many students do not have adequate knowledge of BIPOC history and the policies that
contributed to racial inequity, SUNY campuses serving New York’s diverse communities have a
responsibility and opportunity to help dismantle systemic racism and build racial equity and social
justice.

RESOLUTION:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED​ that UFS calls upon campus governance bodies to work with those
in charge of curriculum to develop and implement (or expand upon) courses or course content that
focus specifically on issues of Racial Equity and Social Justice (in addition to other courses focusing
on the broad category of Equity, Inclusion, and Diversity); and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED​ that UFS calls upon campus governance bodies to work with those in
charge of programming to develop and implement (or expand upon) Racial Equity and Social Justice
co-curricular or extracurricular programming consisting of forums, workshops, guest lectures, etc.
open to and inclusive of the entire campus community; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED​ that to educate all our undergraduate as well as graduate students,
faculty, staff, and administrators on the workings and impact of systemic racism, UFS calls upon
1

campus governance bodies to develop strategies to maximize participation in the academic curriculum
on Racial Equity and Social Justice as well as in the activities of the all-campus programming on the
subject.
