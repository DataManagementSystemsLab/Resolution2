Resolution to Create the Innovation Laboratory
Whereas in response to the public health COVID-19 crisis SUNY Old Westbury transitioned to remote
teaching during the Spring 2020 semester which has continued through both the Fall 2020 and Spring
2021 semesters, and
Whereas the faculty rose to the challenge of reestablishing their teaching practice in new or unfamiliar
modes of instruction including Remote and hybrid/blended, and
Whereas there is already a Distance Learning Policy 1, which formally requires that faculty must
complete the appropriate modality training offered by Distance Learning in order to teach in
hybrid/blended, and online asynchronous (also known as .NET courses) modalities, and
Whereas faculty who have already been trained in asynchronous online and/or hybrid/blended
teaching modalities will maintain credentials for teaching in those modalities, and
Whereas there have been no previous training modules in Remote synchronous teaching, and
Whereas the policy requiring training in hybrid/blended teaching was suspended to give faculty
flexibility during the crisis, and
Whereas individual experiential learning risks missing possibilities and implementing less than
optimum solutions that exposure to alternative approaches and reflection on successes and failures
can help avoid, and
Whereas faculty and the instructional design team experience with Remote and hybrid/blended
teaching is currently the best source of knowledge about best practices and potential pitfalls of these
modalities, and many Old Westbury faculty are now at the cutting edge of distance instruction, and
Whereas over the course of the past year, our own creative faculty have already conducted interactive,
one-hour sessions to share innovative tools, techniques, and strategies that enhance student
engagement and learning in the featured components of distance instruction, and
Whereas faculty who adopted Remote and hybrid/blended instruction would seem to be likely to
benefit more from collegial interactions to round out their familiarity with the best practices and
potential pitfalls of hybrid/blended pedagogy than from more standardized training sessions at this
point,
Be it therefore resolved that the Teaching Learning Resource Committee, along with the Center for
Excellence in Teaching and Learning and the Office for Distance Learning create the temporary
credentialing opportunity during the Spring 2021 semester up until June15, 2021 called the Innovation
Laboratory to share our expertise and support faculty in teaching in innovative ways.

Be it therefore also resolved that any one of the following options will be considered equivalent to
Remote and hybrid/blended training for certification.
•

Active participation in at least three sessions led by others either during the Spring
2021 Innovation Labs sessions, or during the Summer/Fall 2020 Lessons Learned sessions, or
during the Fall 2020 Community of Practice on Distance Instruction sessions. Faculty
completing this requirement will be recognized by the Office of Distance Learning as obtaining
Practitioner status in Remote and Hybrid/Blended instruction.

•

Facilitation of one session and active participation in two other sessions led by
others either during the Spring 2021 Innovation Labs sessions, or during the Summer/Fall 2020
Lessons Learned sessions, or during the Fall 2020 Community of Practice on Distance
Instruction sessions. Faculty completing this requirement will be recognized by the Office of
Distance Learning as obtaining both Practitioner and Instructional Innovator status in Remote
and Hybrid/Blended instruction.

•

Facilitation of two sessions (with the same topic) offered at two different time
slots, once during the Spring 2021 semester and once between commencement
and June 15th, and active participation in one other session led by others during the
Spring 2021 Innovation Labs sessions. Faculty completing this requirement will be recognized
by the Office of Distance Learning as obtaining both Practitioner and Instructional Innovator
status in Remote and Hybrid/Blended instruction.
