RESOLUTION

ON DSI

Unanimously passed by the Faculty Senate on October 12, 2001
WHEREAS DSI has traditionally been awarded for merit and equity and

WHEREAS such merit and equity has not been shown to be, nor has it historically been assumed to be, a function

of base salary or academic rank, and

WHEREAS the allocation of DSI awards as a function of base salary or as a function of academic rank compounds
inequity,

â€˜THEREFORE be it resolved that the Faculty Senate urges the administrators who are making final award
determinations, to recommend lump sum as opposed to percentage DSI awards.
Sent this 12" day of October, 2001 to President Calvin O. Butts, Attn: Mona Rankin
Ce: Dr. Aubrey Bonnett, Vice President, Academic Affairs
