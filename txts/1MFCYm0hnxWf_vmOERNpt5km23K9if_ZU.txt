RESOLUTION

Education Assessment

WHEREAS the SUNY Board of Trustees voted to pursue a standardized system-wide assessment of general
education in June 2003; and
WHEREAS

the purpose of general education assessment has been understood to be an evaluation of a campus’

programs, not an assessment of individual students; and

WHEREAS

it is our belief that assessment needs to be a campus-based activity for the following reasons:

Such a standardized system-wide assessment would interfere explicitly with the fundamental academic freedom
of instructors in discussing their subject, an important element of higher education in a democracy.

A standardized system-wide assessment would appear to presuppose a system-wide curriculum, which would

tend to undermine the rigor and comprehensive nature of each campus’ General Education Program.
The College of Environmental Science and Forestry created a General Education Assessment Plan mandated by
SUNY System Administration which was approved by ESF’s Faculty Governance in May 2002 and approved
by SUNY GEAR under the auspicies of SUNY Central Administration’s Provost’s office, and which is
currently in its first year of a three-year cycle of implementation.
SUNY-ESF adopted the SUNY Learning Outcomes and Guidelines for the Approval of State University
General Education Requirement Courses and in addition developed for our campus a more in-depth set of
learning objectives.
The logistics of such testing would appear to be insurmountable, given that general education occurs throughou
each student’s undergraduate tenure, with students following numerous individual routes in choosing from the
intellectually rich diversity that is appropriate to a university education; and given that general education
requirements can be met through coursework taken at other institutions, including high schools and study
abroad programs, making an examination given at one campus an evaluation not only of that campus but of
many other teaching and learning environments.
Uniform system-wide standardized assessment at any point prior to the completion of the undergraduate genera
education experience would not reflect the accomplishments of the graduate.
Any funds which might be spent developing such a vehicle would be better spent on enhancing individual
campus-based undergraduate assessment.

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT: the Faculty of the SUNY College of Environmental Science and

Forestry will continue to follow the General Education Assessment Plan of its own design, and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT: the Faculty of the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry
will not support, embrace, or voluntarily participate in any SUNY-mandated standardized General Education

Assessment Plan that:
¢ Does not involve ESF faculty, nor facilitates ultimate ESF faculty approval, in both the design and

e
e
e

implementation of a system-wide assessment instrument
Utilizes a battery of “high stakes” standardized tests delivered to all SUNY students
Establishes a linkage between campus performance in General Education as assessed using a system-wide
instrument and individual SUNY campus budget allocations

Publicly reports “raw” scores derived from a system-wide assessment instrument
Does not consider or measure each campus’ “value added” as a component in the assessment of General

Education learning outcomes
Is inadequately funded by SUNY Central Administration, or draws upon existing local campus budget

resources.
