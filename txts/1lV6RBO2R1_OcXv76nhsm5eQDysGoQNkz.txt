Motion: To Expand Bylaws Committee Membership
Whereas, The Faculty Bylaws charge the Faculty Rights and Responsibilities Committee with
forming a Bylaws subcommittee to “review relevance and appropriateness of existing Faculty
Bylaws” (Art. VII §D,1(c)ii), and make provision for the appointment of “two additional
members to serve on the Bylaws Committee during the formal five year Bylaws review” (Art. VII
§D,2); and,
Whereas, During the 2013-14 academic year, the Senate Exec. solicited and received significant
input from faculty committee chairs regarding areas for revision in the Bylaws with respect to
committee function; and
Whereas, An earlier incarnation of the Bylaws Committee developed an inventory of areas of
within the Bylaws in need of reconsideration and possible revision; and
Whereas, A formal Bylaws review has not taken place since 2006;
Therefore Be it Resolved, That the Faculty Senate approve appointment of six (6) additional
members to serve during the 2014-15 academic year as members of the Bylaws Committee, to
work with the membership of the Faculty Rights and Responsibilities Committee to analyze,
develop and recommend revisions to the Bylaws, for consideration by the Senate and for
amendment by the Faculty; and
Let it be Further Resolved, That such members shall be appointed by the Senate Chair and
serve until the end of the 2014-15 academic year, and for the explicit purposes of making
progress towards the completion of a comprehensive review of the Faculty Bylaws, according to
the Bylaws.
