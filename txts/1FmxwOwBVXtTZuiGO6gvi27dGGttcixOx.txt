Old Westbury Senate Resolution
In Opposition to the Bush Administration’s Plan for War against Iraq
October 18, 2002

Whereas, the Bush administration’s plan for a ‘preemptive’ US war on Iraq to attain a
‘regime change’ is a violation of several provisions of the UN Charter, among them

Article 1, Section 4, which states that “all members shall refrain in their international

relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political
independence of any state,” and

Whereas, a US military invasion would result in the killing of countless numbers of Iraqi
civilians and deepen the already existing humanitarian crisis in Iraq, and

Whereas even if Iraq has biological and chemical weapons and is developing a nuclear
weapon, this, in itself, is not a clear and immediate danger to the United States justifying
war, and

Whereas, there is no substantiated evidence that the government of Iraq aided the
September 11 attacks or is currently aiding al-Qaeda, and

Whereas, the proposed war would destabilize the Middle East and jeopardize world
energy supplies, and
Whereas, the US-British rationale of ‘preemptive self-defense’ sets a dangerous
precedent for any nation to attack another that allegedly has weapons of mass destruction,

and

.

Whereas, war might trigger an escalation of the very terrorism that the Bush

administration claims that it is trying to prevent, and

Whereas, a primary underlying motive for war might well be the expansion of US power
and control of Mideast oil, and
Whereas, war would divert hundreds of billions of dollars from funds for domestic

healthcare, prescription drugs and education,
Therefore,

Be it resolved that we, the Faculty Senate of SUNY College at Old Westbury, go on

record, along with a mounting number of people internationally and in the United States,
as expressing our ardent opposition to the Bush administration’s plan for a ‘preemptive’
war against Iraq; and

Be it further resolved that we call for a peaceful resolution of any differences between the
United States and Iraq; and
Be it further resolved that we support SUNY College at Old Westbury President Calvin
Butts III for publicly opposing the US plan for war against Iraq; and

SY" \

Be it further resolved that we back the resolution passed by United University

Professionals, American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO, against a US military

invasion of Iraq; and

Be it further resolved that we voice our disapproval of New York Senators Charles

Schumer and Hillary Clinton for their endorsement of President Bush’s authority to wage

war on Iraq, and we urge them to reconsider their position.
