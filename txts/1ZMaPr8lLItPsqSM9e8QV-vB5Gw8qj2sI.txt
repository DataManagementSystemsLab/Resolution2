American Studies Resolution on “Smart” Classrooms
Whereas, the “smart classrooms” were so-designated because they purported to support audio-visual
presentation as a component of academic teaching, and;
Whereas, several of the DVD players and other essential components necessary to teaching media and
other disciplines are either not functioning or missing, and;
Whereas, the temporary solution of portable DVD player or laptop computer (to be signed out by faculty
who must surrender a driver’s license to the Help Desk) can result in connectivity problems, delays, and
confusion during the precious minutes between classes when students have questions or need
assistance, and;
Whereas, connectivity issues and bandwidth limitations prevent reliable streaming of online video
resources as an alternative, and;
Whereas, inadequate or poorly-functioning classroom technology can hinder effective teaching, create
an impression among students that the College is not properly equipped, and have a negative impact on
students’ learning and experience at the College.

Therefore, be it resolved that the Senate request a report from the Instructional Technology
department, and/or the IT Governance Committee, about the state of the “smart classrooms” and the
schedule for refreshing equipment when needed, and;
Be it further resolved that IT work with Academic Affairs and affected departments to ensure that a
complete and up-to-date array of reliable devices be provided promptly in each of rooms currently
designated as “smart classrooms.”
