Resolution on Flex Modality Training
Whereas in response to the public health COVID-19 crisis SUNY Old Westbury
transitioned to remote teaching during the Spring 2020 semester, which has continued
through Spring 2021, and
Whereas there is already a Distance Learning Policy i which formally requires that faculty
must complete appropriate training offered by the Office of Distance Learning in order to
teach their first course in the hybrid/blended modality, and their first course in the online
asynchronous (also known as NET) modality, which includes workshops and supervised
development of the initial course offering in each modality, and
Whereas the Distance Learning Policy also allows exemptions based on equivalent
prior training and experience that faculty may have, and
Whereas the Distance Learning Policy was temporarily suspended for the Spring 2020
through Spring 2021 semesters in regard to hybrid/blended modalities to give faculty
flexibility during the public health crisis, and
Whereas the modalities of Remote and Flex were newly added to course modality
options in Spring 2021 and Fall 2021, and
Whereas the Resolution to Create the Innovation Laboratory passed by the Faculty
Senate on Feb. 19, 2021 established new pathways to fulfill Remote and hybrid/blended
training, and
Whereas the Joint Task Force on Distance Learning Policies and Standards has been
formed to consider updating Distance Learning Policies, and plans to make some
recommendations for more comprehensive and permanent plans after this semester,
and
Whereas the Online Institutional Readiness Implementation Plan recommends the
college to enhance training for all distance modalities, and
Whereas of all modalities available in Fall 2021, the Flex modality lacks an officially
endorsed pathway for obtaining training, despite the fact that the delivery of Flex
courses requires mastery of certain software and hardware, and
Whereas Instructional Design Staff already provides an informal training session for the
Flex modality but that training is not formalized by an y official policy,
Therefore Be It Resolved that an official training pathway for the Flex modality be
formally established by Instructional Design Staff and the Office of Distance Learning
that is appropriately similar to the pathways which currently exist for other modalities, as
well as appropriate exemptions for equivalent previous training (similar to the other
modalities), and

Be It Further Resolved that before faculty teach in the Flex modality in Fall 2021 and
beyond they shall be required to first complete the Flex training unless Instructional
Design Staff and the Office of Distance Learning determines they are exempted by
equivalent previous training.
