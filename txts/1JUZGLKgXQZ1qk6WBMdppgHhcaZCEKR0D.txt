RESOLUTION ON THE ROLE OF CAMPUS
REVIEW II

GOVERNANCE

IN MISSION

Whereas continuity in University and campus programs and goals resides in the faculty,
and
Whereas System Administration has mandated the active participation of campus
governance in the Mission Review II processes, and

Whereas the generation of campus guidance documents is a critical step in the Mission
Review process, and

Whereas it is apparent that to date there has been great variability across the System

regarding effective inclusion of campus governance structures,

Therefore, be it Resolved that

The University Faculty Senate asks the Chancellor, or his designee, to communicate with

each campus President, in writing, reaffirmation of the crucial importance, for_formal
faculty participation through the established campus governance structures|in every step

in Mission Review II (planning, drafting and revising the guidance documents,
representation on campus visitation teams, and planned implementation of the
Memorandum of Understanding) and
Be it further Resolved that

A record of such participation be attached to both the campus guidance document and the

final campus Memorandum of Understanding. Such a record should include the
processes by which the guidance documents were drafted; the role of campus governance
in discussing, endorsing, and/ or ratifying such documents; and the provisions for
including campus governance structures in both the campus visitations and the planned

MOU implementation.
