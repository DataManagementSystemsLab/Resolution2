EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Academic Assessment at OW has been highly segmented by School with varied level of practice
and resources.
ü SOE and SOB have established program-level assessment to satisfy accreditation
requirements and have received personnel support and resources to support the work.
ü SAS departments are responsible for Institutional-level Student Learning Outcome
(ISLO) assessment and Program-level Student Learning outcome (PSLO) assessment.
There have been no dedicated resources for program-level assessment in SAS or SPS.
ü Regular ISLO assessment data collection has been established with coordination by CoDAA and LEC. This practice has been long-standing but resources to support the
assessment practice are negotiated annually.
ü Prior to Spring 2021, PSLO assessment in SAS departments without discipline specific
accreditation was only documented through CAP Five Year Review. There was no
organized process nor resource to support regular and ongoing PSLO assessment.

•

Middle States Self Study and verbal and written feedback from the MSCHE Team in March
2021 identified the imminent need of establishing a systematic and regular process for PSLO
assessment practice and utilization of assessment data (PSLO and ISLO) in SAS and SPS.
These points were reiterated in the June 24 request for Supplemental Information Report (SIR).
Specific points of concern include:
ü The lack of an organized process for, and a regular practice of, PSLO assessment data
collection in programs without discipline-specific accreditation.
ü The lack of an organized process for, and a regular and documented practice of sharing
PSLO and ISLO assessment results with stakeholders and utilizing them for the
improvement of curriculum and student learning experience.
ü PSLOs are “clearly written,” but some are “not sufficiently linked to the underlying
discipline(s)”.

•

Since the MSCHE Team visit, the processes to facilitate an organized, systematic, and
meaningful PSLO assessment have been designed and implemented. Specifically,
ü The Program Assessment Plan for each degree program, including PSLOs, a
curriculum map, multi-year strategic assessment schedule, and a plan for assessment data
sharing and feedback (Spring 2021, to be revised at the completion of the Assessment
Fellows Program).
ü Degree (Major) Program Assessment Year-End Report, which includes updates on
student learning data collection, the utilization of assessment data, and changes in
assessment tools (June 2021).
ü The Assessment Fellows Program, as a preparatory program for the SAS Assessment
Coordinator System (pending funding).
ü An academic assessment website with PSLOs, curriculum maps and assessment FAQs.

•

As a result, SAS and SPS departments improved assessment tools since the MSCHE visit and
are now engaging with more regular, strategic and better documented assessment practice
with active facilitation of “Closing the Loop.”
Co-Directors of Academic Assessment Report 2020-2021 -

ü All SAS departments and SPS have PSLOs linked to the discipline, curriculum maps and
a strategic multi-year assessment schedule for their degree programs.
ü Multiple SAS departments created a departmental assessment committee.
ü Most of SAS departments and SPS will have completed at least one PSLO assessment by
the end of Fall 2021. The rest of departments will commence data collection in Spring
2021.
ü Assessment Fellows receive training in assessment and engage with collective problem
solving in biweekly meetings.
ü Assessment Fellows are coordinating departmental assessment practice and facilitating
inter-departmental communication.
ü Almost all SAS departments and SPS have some plans to share and discuss PSLO
assessment results within the department and the rest are in the process of creating them.
ü A shift toward meaningful, action-oriented assessment in SAS departments are facilitated
through various Fellows activities.
ü Four SAS departments are engaging with “Closing the Loop Showcase” activity utilizing
recent assessment reports and are scheduled to share outcomes with broader audience in
Spring 2022.
•

The Liberal Education Committee (LEC) has established a systematic process for ongoing
ISLO assessment and utilization of assessment data (“Closing the Loop”) to inform the
liberal education curriculum.
ü A new 5-year schedule has been established to ensure the assessment for every domain
and competency in the Liberal Education Program (LEP).
ü A 5-phase model for assessment has been developed that engages each domain in the
assessment process every academic year. The phases ensure ongoing data collection,
analysis, and communication and utilization of assessment data to inform the curriculum
(“Close the Loop”).
ü LEC meetings now include regular, structured conversations about assessment and
“Closing the Loop” activities in domains.
ü The process of transitioning to LEAP+ is ongoing, with a complete process of mapping
domains to LEAP Essential Learning Outcomes.
ü The LEC decided to create detailed rubrics to create a more rigorous assessment
process, with plans to begin the process in AY 2021-22.

•

Moving forward,
ü What We Must Do
§ Follow through with continuous assessment practice
§ Schedule a routine review of the Assessment Plan
§ Establish regular and documented assessment data sharing and utilization
§ Create documentation to ensure continuity of assessment through personnel
changes in LEC
ü Where We Want to Go
§ Faculty-centered, faculty-embraced assessment
§ Assessment as resource
§ Vibrant teaching & learning + curricular building + assessment synergy
§ Creative, multi-faceted academic assessment

I. ACADEMIC ASSESSMENT IN TRANSITION
During the first year of the appointment, Co-DAAs focused on identifying the situation of academic
assessment at the College and gathering basic information of existing academic assessment practice.
This work coincided with the Middle States Self Study process (both Co-DAAs served on Standard V
Work Group; Dr. Lien was a Work Group Co-Chair).
Meanwhile, for ISLO assessment, student learning outcome data were gathered for three LEP domains:
American Experience, Humanities and Western Tradition (reports in Appendices). On the side of PSLO
assessment, the information for SAS programs was sporadic. In Spring 2020, the Degree Program
Assessment Year End Report was gathered from Academic Departments as a pilot study (see Appendix
for the form).
Co-DAAs participated in various external professional development opportunities including
“Assessment Conversation” Workshop by MSCHE (March 2020), Assessment of Learning Outcome
Certificate courses by SUNY Council on Assessment (SCoA, Spring 2020), SCoA Workshop
“Maintaining Culture of Assessment in Difficult Times” (Fall 2020), and other virtual conferences and
workshops. In June 2020, Co-DAAs participated in AAC&U’s Summer Institute in General Education
Assessment (IGEA) as a part of the College Team (along with Jacob Heller, Ashok Basawapatna, and
Orquidea Morales). At the IGEA Institute, the Old Westbury Team developed an “Action Plan” for the
transitions and improvements planned for the LEP at the College.
A decision was reached as a result of the IGEA Summer Institute experience in June 2020 to pause LEP
assessment for AY 20-21. Instead of continuing assessment as planned, the team decided to use the year
to evaluate and modify assessment practices as the LEC worked on the LEAP+ transition. Part of the
evaluation process included “assessment of assessment” conversations with various stakeholders.
During fall 2020, the Co-DAA’s held three conversations with LEC domain representatives who had
previous experience conducting syllabi reviews and learning outcome assessments. In addition, the CoDAA’s met with two academic departments who contribute to the LEP and were at different stages of
their own program assessment.
Topics of discussion included perceived roles of the LEC/ Dept, experience with assessment and
recollection of past practice, results of assessment, recommendations for improving the process, and a
discussion of support needed to improve the LEP/program. Detailed notes were taken during the
conversations and reviewed to identify relevant themes. Themes for program assessment included
infrequency of assessment, lack of information, challenges with current practice, and barriers to
“Closing the Loop”. Themes for LEP assessment included lack of awareness of LEP, confusion about
LEC’s role in assessment, assessment quality concerns, no follow-up or “Closing the Loop”. Various
recommendations emerged for both program and LEP assessment (see Appendix for Assessment
Conversation Themes).
The time of transition in academic assessment leadership coincided with the turbulent period of constant
contingency planning and instructional adjustment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to evaluate
the impact of remote instruction and provide information to contextualize student learning data, the
Assessment Team consisting of Co-DAAs and AVP IEA conducted the Mid-Semester Remote
Instruction Faculty Survey (see Appendix for the report).

II. Middle States Self Study & MSCHE Team Visit
The Middle States Self Study made it clear that the lack of organized, regular and documented
assessment practice in SAS and SPS is a significant issue of concern. The Self Study also identified that,
while ISLO assessment had a regular, established process of assessment data collection coordinated by
LEC and Co-DAA, no organized process to facilitate the “Closing the Loop” (See Figure II-1) was in
place. These concerns were echoed by the MSCHE Visit Team during their visit.

In order to address these concerns, the Self Study made the following recommendations.
Recommendation 5.1: The College should pursue a more organized process of following
up and ensuring that improvements based on LEP assessment results are made in all
relevant academic departments.
Recommendation 5.2: Regular Conduct of Academic Assessment - For academic
degree programs (i.e., majors) not governed by specialized, discipline-specific
accreditation requirements for program student learning outcome assessment, the
College should implement a standard process of program assessment, in consultation
with faculty governance. Every Academic Department offering a degree program should
have completed a Departmental Assessment Plan by April 1, 2021. The Assessment Plan
should include PSLOs, a curriculum map, assessment schedule, and a system for
“Closing the Loop,” and should be coordinated with the 5-Year CAP Departmental
Review process. For the initial iteration, Program Assessment Plans should be reviewed

by an assessment group comprised of the School Dean or Director, the Assistant Vice
President for Institutional Effectiveness and Assessment, the Co-Directors of Academic
Assessment, and CAP Committee representatives.
Recommendation 5.3: Academic Assessment Reporting - Each Academic Department
Chair should report to their Dean or Director annually in May, regarding the completion
of Program Academic Assessment for each degree program (major) offered by that
department, according to the Assessment Plan on file with Academic Affairs. Such
reports and their findings should be kept on record in Academic Affairs and will inform
planning and resource allocation decisions.
The Self Study and the MSCHE Team confirmed that SOB, SOE and one SAS program that follow
discipline-specific accreditation requirements have an established and documented assessment process
with an embedded “Closing the Loop” process.
The Self Study did not include an inventory of PSLOs from SAS and SPS programs, but they were later
submitted at the request of the MSCHE Team. The Team concluded that these PSLOs are “clearly
written,” but some are “not sufficiently linked to the underlying discipline(s)”. Absent curriculum maps
and some “multi-purposed” sets of PSLOs contributed to this conclusion.
Meetings with campus stakeholders and the MSCHE Team identified that inequity in academic
assessment resources across Schools may have contributed to the varied level of academic assessment
practice. While SOE and SOB have established program-level assessment to satisfy accreditation
requirements and have received personnel support and resources to support the work, SAS programs
received no dedicated resource(s) to build and sustain academic assessment. The equity in resource
seems more profound considering SAS hosts the largest number of academic programs with a great
diversity in subject matters. SAS Departments are also responsible for gathering ISLO assessment data
(coordinated by LEC and Co-DAA) since the LEP consists of courses offered by SAS Departments. The
MSCHE Team clarified 1) the need of infrastructure to support regular assessment practice in SAS and
SPS, such as an assessment liaison in each academic program, 2) the need of resources to support such
practice, and 3) the need of a process that facilitates the “Closing the Loop” more regularly than Five
Year Reviews. See Appendix for a list of the MSCHE Team Standard V Recommendations and
Collegial Advice.

III. Transition Accelerated
In response to concerns raised by the MSCHE Team and anticipated SIR, the Assessment Team started
multiple initiatives. On June 24, the MSCHE issued a request for the SIR which documents concrete
evidence that the College is making a satisfactory progress regarding seven criteria, six of which are on
academic assessment1. The SIR request confirmed the expectations discussed with the MSCHE Team.
The SIR request, as well as two follow-up meetings with the MSCHE Liaison Dr. Peavy (Aug 3 with
Jacob Heller and Nov 1 with Frank Sanacory, Mike Kavic, Cris Notaro, Courtney Raeford, Ashlee Lien
and Ryoko Yamamoto) confirmed the importance of meaningful assessment, i.e., bottom-up, actionoriented academic assessment, in which academic assessment is purposefully conducted and the
results are routinely utilized for curricular and pedagogical improvements (“Closing the Loop”).
Follow-up meetings with Dr. Peavy also confirmed that the expectations are to provide concrete
evidence that the College is making satisfactory progress toward these goals. It was explicitly affirmed
that expecting academic programs to move from not having established assessment practice to “Closing
the Loop” in less than one year is unrealistic if not impossible, and the expectation at the point of SIR is
building a systematic process for meaningful assessment and concrete evidence of the solid progress
in—not the completion of—the assessment cycle.
In order to accelerate a transition to action-oriented academic assessment and demonstrate the use of
assessment data in SAS during a short timeframe, Co-DAAs implemented two additional initiatives:
Curriculum Conversation Report Project and “Closing the Loop” Model Program Showcase.
A.

ISLO Assessment Initiatives
1. LEAP+ Integration

On April 22, 2016, the Faculty Senate approved a resolution to adopt the AACU’s LEAP Essential
Learning Outcomes (strengthened by the Old Westbury Mission) as a model for liberal education
institutional outcomes. A task force had been proposed to implement these changes, however, work on
the transition did not begin until the initial mapping process in spring 2019. Discussions about the
LEAP+ transition, led by the assessment team, resulted in the continuation of the mapping process in
LEC during AY 20-21. During this process, domain representatives examined the LEAP VALUE

rubrics and compared them with the SUNY General Education learning outcomes for more detailed
alignment with SUNY Old Westbury’s existing LEP and a gap analysis. The mapping process was
completed for all domains, excluding Western Tradition and American Experience, by April 2021.
Transitioning to LEAP+ will align OW with best practices for liberal education and provide guidance
for improving the quality of assessment through adaptation of VALUE Rubrics to OW’s LEP.
Anticipated completion for the LEAP+ transition is the end of AY 22-23. The next stage of LEAP+
integration will occur after the release of final implementation guidance for the new SUNY General
Education Program. The work for this changes will be led by the LEC and the Co-DAA.
2. 5-Phase Assessment Cycle
(Table) Self-study recommendation 5.1/ items 5 and 7 from MS-SIR
Outcomes of assessment conversations clearly identified a need for a clear process of assessment with a
structure to promote accountability for “Closing the Loop” activities. In addition, Self Study
Recommendation 5.1 highlights a need for an “organized process of following up and ensuring that
improvements based on LEP assessment results are made in all relevant academic departments”.
Additionally, request 5 and 7 from the MS-SIR recognize the need for organized and systematic
assessments for student achievement and the documented use of assessment results. As a result, a new 5phase process of assessment was developed to guide the assessment process of the LEP.
The new 5-phase assessment cycle (see Table III-A1) was presented in the LEC during fall 2021. In this
process, each domain engages in a phase of the assessment cycle each year. The 5-phase cycle will
occur over a 5-year period, progressing to the next phase of the cycle at the beginning of the next
academic year.
Phase 1: Syllabus Review
a. Timing: The syllabus review will typically occur in the fall to balance assessment
activities carried out in the Liberal Education Committee (LEC). This review may be
postponed until the spring for domains that may have more representative courses offered
in the spring, or for domain representatives who are unable to coordinate assessment
efforts during the fall semester.
b. Collect syllabi for all courses being taught in the domain during the assessment period.
c. Syllabi will be evaluated for presence of domain-specific learning outcomes and linkages
of learning outcomes to listed discussion topics, readings, and assignments.
d. Reports will be prepared by domain representatives for presentation at LEC. Upon
presentation, reports will be distributed to instructors and Departments contributing to the
domain.
e. Reports will be compiled in repository (Weave or other relevant software).
Phase 2: Learning Outcome (LO) Assessment
a. Co-DAA will work with domain representative to establish sampling plan for the LO
assessment. Domain representative will conduct initial outreach to faculty in the semester
prior to LO assessment.

Co-Directors of Academic Assessment Report 2020-2021 - 12

b. Co-DAA and domain representative will guide faculty included in the sample with
assignment selection and utilizing LEP rubrics to assess student artifacts. Data collection
will be completed upon the end of the semester.
c. Reports will be prepared by Co-DAA in consultation with domain representatives.
d. Presentation of reports will be conducted in LEC in the semester following assessment
and distributed to instructors and Departments contributing to the domain.
e. Reports will be compiled in repository (Weave or other relevant software).
Phase 3: Domain Revisions/ Curricular Support
a. During this phase, assessments conducted in phases 1 and 2 will be revisited and
reviewed in detail. LEC will complete a discussion of challenges/ weaknesses and
successes/ strengths, with the goal of making adjustments to improve the domain.
b. Discussions held in LEC will focus on action items to address the challenges or reinforce
the strengths identified through assessment phases 1 and 2.
c. Action items may emphasize student learning or faculty instruction of the learning
outcomes. Revisions for this phase should not focus on the assessment process.
d. Recommendations should be enacted and may include direct support to departments
and/or faculty teaching in the domain, refinement of documents to guide course design
and instruction, and recommendations for inclusion/ exclusion of courses in the domain.
e. If a course is found not to address domain-specific learning outcomes, direct support
should be provided to the department offering the course and it must be included in the
phase 4 (re)assessment process.
f. LEC is encouraged to design workshops for faculty specifically focusing on LEP
recommendations identified during this phase.
g. Summary reports will be created by domain representative and distributed to the LEC.
h. Reports will be compiled in repository (Weave or other relevant software).
Phase 4: Mini (Re)Assessment
a. A subsection of courses included in the phases 1 and 2 will be reassessed to monitor
improvements and revisions.
b. Co-DAA will work with the domain representative to identify a sample of courses to be
included. Domain representatives will initiate contact with faculty to be included in the
sample.
c. Any courses identified as not addressing domain-specific learning outcomes in phase 3
must be included in the phase 4 (re)assessment process.
d. Co-DAA and domain representative will guide faculty included in the sample with
assignment selection and utilizing LEP rubrics to assess student artifacts. Data collection
will be completed upon the end of the semester. Domain representative will serve as
second rater for a random selection of assignments.
e. Reports will be prepared by Co-DAA in consultation with domain representatives.
f. Presentation of reports will be conducted in LEC upon conclusion of reassessment and
distributed to instructors and Departments contributing to the domain.
g. Reports will be compiled in repository (Weave or other relevant software).

Co-Directors of Academic Assessment Report 2020-2021 - 13

Phase 5: Revisions
a. Based on phase 4 reassessment, determine what further revisions need to be made to
strengthen the domain.
b. LEC may consider hosting workshops for faculty focusing on ongoing recommendations
made during this phase. Other support may be provided to faculty teaching in the domain
through discussions and verbal or written guidance.
c. During this phase, courses that did not address domain-specific learning outcomes in
phase 3 should be discussed. If the courses still do not address the domain learning
outcomes, LEC should create a recommendation for inclusion/exclusion from the domain
and any associated action steps for the contributing Department.
d. Summary reports will be created by domain representative and distributed to the LEC.
e. Reports will be compiled in repository (Weave or other relevant software).

PSLO Assessment Initiatives
1. Program Assessment Plan (Spring 2021)

In accordance with Self Study Recommendation 5.2 (Regular Conduct of Academic Assessment), in
Spring 2021, the Assessment Team requested Department Chairs to submit the Assessment Plan for
each degree program offered in their Department with a priority deadline of April 1st.
The Program Assessment Plan consists of A) a current set of PSLOs (see Appendix), B) a curriculum
map, C) a multi-year schedule for assessing a full set of PSLOs with courses and measures used for data
collection, D) plans for other forms of assessment than PSLO assessment, and E) plans for sharing
results of sharing PSLO assessment outcomes. The Assessment Team created a template as well as
curriculum map and schedule examples (see Appendix for a template). Departments were asked to
create a schedule that assesses all PSLOs at least once within the Five Year Review period. Programs
with discipline-specific accreditation submitted the assessment report to the discipline-specific
accreditors in lieu of the Assessment Plan.
The Assessment Plans have been submitted for all degree programs without a discipline-specific
accreditation. This is the first time the College-wide inventory of core PSLO assessment tools have been
created. The Program Assessment Plan was designed with five underlying objectives:
1. Norm-setting. Communicate basic expectations for program-level assessment with
stakeholders.
2. Provide Resources. Provide templates as resources.
3. Accelerate Assessment Practice. A clear deadline (with persistent reminders) encourages
departments without established assessment practice to prioritize designing assessment
instruments and starting the process.
4. Opportunity for Collective Reflection and Strategic Planning. Composing a formal
assessment plan for submission provides departments an opportunity to formalize, reflect on
and improve existing assessment practice. The request for a multi-year schedule requires
strategic planning for assessment data gathering.
5. Documentation. Allows the College to create a comprehensive inventory of PSLOs,
curriculum maps and assessment schedules for the first time.
With the completion of the Program Assessment Plans, now all SAS and SPS departments have a multiyear schedule that ensures all PSLOs are assessed within the five year cycle for its degree programs and
a concrete plan to review, discuss and utilize results of academic assessment. Tables in the following
pages show the schedule for a full PSLO set assessment (III-B1), departmental “Closing the Loop”
plans (III-B2), and plans for additional forms of assessment (III-B3) for SAS and SPS degree programs.
Self Study Recommendation 5.2 stated that “an assessment group” consisting of the Assessment Team,
the Dean, and a faculty representative from the Curriculum and Academic Planning (CAP) Committee
would review the Plans and make recommendations for improvements. This plan was modified when
the Assessment Fellows Program emerged. Instead of a review by an external group, Assessment
Fellows from each department were charged to review the current Program Assessment Plan and lead
the department in making improvements during AY2021-2022.

To effectively utilize assessment data, an annual department meeting will be
convened by the Departmental Assessment Committee. The goals of this
meeting will be to collectively analyze assessment outcomes and discuss the
Biological Sciences program curriculum. Specifically, the Department will
discuss what the students are learning effectively, what they are not learning
effectively, and what modifications or resources will be needed to achieve
student learning goals. Recommendations, if any, will be made at least at
several levels, including curriculum, faculty support, pedagogy, student
support, resources, and lastly the assessment plan itself. If needed, additional
meetings will be convened.
Results of assessment will be shared by faculty members in the Chemistry
and Physics department at department meetings and will be used to guide
discussions about curriculum improvements. Assessment results will be filed
in the main department office. A goal is to track how students are progressing
from the foundation courses to more advanced chemistry courses in our
department. The assessment results will be used to determine necessary
pedagogy or modality change in the curriculum. Information from the
assessment will help identify preparedness of our students and provide
targeted prep courses or specific resources. The results will also inform
professional development opportunities for faculty for course design and
delivery.

The Assessment Committee comprises 5 of the 10 full-time department
members, and plans to discuss the assessment plan, cycle, methodology, and
results during department meetings. There will be regular updates and
discussion of assessment activities, including distribution and interpretation of
results to promote continuous improvement, at each monthly department
meeting.
The department discusses in our department meetings assessment results
and their implications for specific courses and the curriculum as a whole.
These reports and discussion should also be part of our self-study every 5year review cycle.

Since we are a small department, we all participate of the assessment
process. Another advantage we have is that we all (or almost all) take turns to
teach all the courses that are assessed, therefore, when challenges are
encountered, we all are able to review the content of courses as well as goals
and intended learning outcomes.

(Same as above)

Bachelors

We have decided to dedicate a meeting at the end of every semester to
discuss the effectiveness of the student learning outcomes. This means that
our PSLO will be reviewed periodically.
A record of these processes will be maintained and shared with the CAP
Committee and any other stakeholders whenever expected or necessary.

The results of PSLO assessment will first be shared with Department
members through discussion in a program meeting. The relevant curriculum
committee will then discuss results as they relate to refining the curriculum
(including but not limited to material and assignments) and make any
necessary changes for improving student learning and mastery of each PSLO.

a centralized repository of assessment results. Once a year assessment
results will be distributed to and discussed by the SPS Faculty Advisory
Committee. The capstone course will be modified as appropriate, and the
program’s structure will be reviewed as part of the Five Year review.
Whenever a new instructor teaches the capstone course, the intent of the
course’s design and results of previous assessments will be reviewed to guide
any customizations.

The above (part C) will require economic faculty meeting at a minimum of
once a year probably during the winter break to discuss the results of the prior
two semesters. We will also include classroom observation when an
opportunity for a particular pedagogical strategy can be demonstrated by one
of our members. Also sharing quantitative exercises is another area we are
looking to integrate across our curriculum.
Department faculty will discuss the assessment outcomes for each course
assessed in the prior semester at the second departmental meeting each
semester. Faculty in specific disciplines can choose to meet in advance to
prepare their recommendations for curricular development or change to the
full departmental faculty.

Program will share assessment results with Department annually. Additionally,
assessment results will be shared with Affiliated Faculty annually. Bi-Annual
meetings of Affiliated Faculty will be held to use assessment results to plan to
identify areas in which to “close the loop”, and to generate new curricula ideas.

In addition to the data obtained from the Assessment Schedule, student
receive site supervisor evaluations for their practicum and internship
experiences. Courses MH6540 Practicum II, MH7130 Clinical Internship I, and
MH7530 Clinical Internship II each result in a supervisor evaluation across
three consecutive semesters. This provides a continuous monitoring of clinical
competence as well as the supervisors observation of the students’ progress
as it relates to learning outcomes.

2. Degree (Major) Program Assessment Year-End Report AY2020-2021 (June 2021)
In accordance with Self Study Recommendation 5.3 (Academic Assessment Reporting), the Degree
(Major) Program Assessment Year-End Report was conducted. Co-DAA designed an online report form
and requested Department Chairs to report program-level academic assessment activities during
AY2020-2021. Twelve Academic Departments (11 SAS, 1 SOE) and SPS reported on the total of
twenty degree programs.
According to the AY2020-2021 Report, eleven academic programs gathered PSLO data during this
academic year (Table III-B4). For programs that revised PLSOs in the process of writing the Program
Assessment Plan, this is a period of transition with different versions of PSLOs. The Program
Assessment Plan also prompted some Departments to create a departmental assessment committee
(Table III-B5). Six Departments reported that “closing the loop” activities took place in this academic
year, including discussing assessment results in a department meeting, changes to course delivery or
scheduling, and changes to assessment tools and practices (Table III B-6).

In the past we changed the structure of Art Tutorials I in response to an assessment. We
separated out the first semester from upper level semesters in order to give students time
to become comfortable with the critique process. We also changed our curriculum to
include an Art History requirement in contemporary art to be available each and every
semester. This course helps to prepare students for tutorials. In this past academic year,
we encouraged students to participate in the group critiques over zoom. They spoke up
about their observations more often than they had previously done.

Childhood

As a result PSLO assessment, the department has decided to reinstate the ED5930 where
students to 100 hours of observation as opposed to distributing it across the methods
courses.

PY

The assessment resulted in the finding that a uniform assignment may not be the best way
to assess learning. Since the instructors did not feel that this assessment was a good
indicator of mastery of the learning outcome, the department discussed and decided that
we would change how this learning outcome was assessed in the future. This LO will now
be assessed at a senior level in a course more targeted to students in the program.

CP

The dept has analyzed prior assessments and made changes to laboratory experiments,
method of delivery, and curriculum content.

PH

Findings suggest the need for more consistent displaying PSLOs, and that some of them
could have improved language. The language of a few have been edited in a draft form, to
be finalized in the new year. Assessment result also triggered changed the supervisor
evaluation to better measurement of PLSO. Learned low performance of students in one
course (partly affected by incompletes due to pandemic). The dept devised strategies to
better meet these needs.

3. Assessment Fellows Program (Sept 2021-Summer 2022) & Assessment Coordinator System
(Fall 2022 -, Pending Funding)
In the conversation with the MSCHE Team, the need of an infrastructure to sustain ongoing PSLO
assessment in SAS, training opportunities, and building an inter-departmental assessment community
were also identified. In SAS Departments, coordinating academic assessment had been one of many
responsibilities of Department Chairs. The vision of the Assessment Coordinator System, and the
Assessment Program as a one-year, preparatory training system, emerged from this conversation.
The Assessment Coordinator System is envisioned as a core infrastructure of academic assessment in
SAS. Each Academic Department will have one assessment liaison who serves as an assessment expert
and a point person in each Department (See Figure III-B1). The Assessment Coordinator System is
expected to become the structural foundation of faculty-owned academic assessment practice in SAS
Departments, cultivating departmental assessment expertise, departmental repository, and an interdepartmental assessment community for collaborative problem solving, peer learning and policy
development.
In April 2021, in response to the RFP from the President’s Office, the Assessment Team submitted a
proposal for the “Curriculum Development Fellows/Curriculum Development Coordinator Program.”
This plan later changed the name to the Assessment Fellows/Assessment Fellows Program, and received
an approval from the President in May 2021. Funding was requested for 1) compensation for Fellows for
their time for training, coordinating departmental assessment practice and facilitating conversations, and
leading the improvements of assessment tools in AY2020-2021 (through summer), 2) workshops and
presentations by external experts, and 3) initial years of the Assessment Coordinator System, with
compensations for coordinators and continued training. At the time of writing this report, the funding
has been committed for 1).

The Assessment Fellows Program launched in Sept 2021. During the summer of 2021, the Dean
requested Department Chairs to recommend a few faculty members who would be suitable to receive
training to be an assessment liaison for the Department. Assessment Fellows were selected from
departmental recommendations and officially appointed by the Provost.
Eligibility of Assessment Fellows includes:
• Tenure-track faculty in an SAS Department; Chairs are not eligible
• Endorsed by the Dean and the Department Chair
• Willingness to serve as an assessment coordinator in the following years
• Willingness to assist other members of the Department to learn about carrying out academic
assessment and utilizing assessment results
Responsibilities include:
• Attend the Fellows orientation, Academic Assessment Workshops, Fellows Roundtables
• Engage with other assessment training opportunities
• Review the existing Departmental Assessment Plan and develop plans for improvements
• Develop guidelines, tools, a training program, and a standard process for “closing the loop” for
the Department’s academic programs
• Share departmental assessment practices with other Fellows and the Co-Directors of Academic
Assessment and offer constructive feedback to other Fellows
• Compose a year-end report that includes
1) the evaluation of the current status of departmental assessment practice and
2) a proposal for improvements
• Coordinate planning, data gathering, and reporting of program assessments with the home
department
• Contribute to college-wide efforts to develop sustainable and useful models for academic
assessment
In AY2021-2022, Assessment Fellows meet twice a month during regular semesters for workshops and
roundtable discussions on a range of topics on academic assessment (Table III-B7). In addition to
attending meetings, Fellows engage with “homework” activities designed to facilitate departmental
conversations on data-based curriculum development and assessment and/or to document departmental
assessment practice. Table IIIB8 shows activities Fellows engaged with in the first two months of the
program (see Appendix for activity instruments).

4. “Closing the Loop” Model Program Showcase
In Fall 2021, four SAS Departments (Chemistry & Physics, English, Public Health and Sociology) were
selected for the “Closing the Loop” Model Program Showcase project. These four Departments are
analyzing recent assessment data to identify strengths and weaknesses of the Program and make action
plans by December, 2021. Outcomes of the project will be shared in Spring 2021 (see Appendix for
instructions and a template).
C.

Other Initiatives
1. Academic Assessment Website

Co-DAAs drafted an Academic Assessment website in the summer of 2021 as a venue to share
assessment-related information with stakeholders. The website includes academic assessment FAQs,
PSLOs and curriculum maps, assessment tools, as well as reference materials (see Appendix). The
website is currently under construction 1) to be integrated into the official college website and 2) to
integrate some content from another website separately developed by the Director of Institutional
Research (DIR).
2. Introducing Assessment Technology (Weave+)
At the recommendation of the MSCHE Team, the AVP IEA started the process for introducing
assessment technology that allows for more systematic and routine storage and sharing of assessment
data. Co-DAAs contributed to the selection process as members of the Assessment Technology Joint
Task Force, which convened four times in June 2021. Of three options considered, the College selected
Weave+ at the recommendation of the Joint Task Force.
Since the departure of the AVP IEA in July 2021, the DIR is taking on implementation of Weave+. CoDAAs play a supportive role, informing the DIR of current academic assessment practices and advising
on implementation strategies and instructional material development.

D. The Current Status of Program Assessment in SAS & SPS
After a series of initiatives described in this section, academic programs in SAS and SPS have made
significant progress in the area of academic assessment practice since the time of Self Study, displaying
clear evidence of emerging organized and systematic academic assessment (see Table III-D1).
SAS and SPS programs now also have plans to discuss assessment results in place and some utilization
of assessment data have been documented in the Year-End Report. The Assessment Fellows Program is
geared toward the facilitation of ongoing, faculty-centered, meaningful assessment. While Fellows lead
the coordination of academic assessment in the Department, multiple SAS Departments also created a
departmental assessment committee, providing further structural support for assessment practice.
Table III-D2 aligns the current status of academic assessment and supporting evidence since Self Study
with MSCHE Standard Criteria addressed in the SIR request.

IV. Moving Forward
Academic assessment in SAS and SPS made a significant progress since the Middle States Self Study
Report. Now all degree programs have basic tools for PSLO assessment on file and implemented a
regular student learning data collection process with a multi-year schedule and a concrete plan to share,
discuss and utilize assessment results. LEC embedded a “Closing the Loop” process in the new fivephase cycle and multi-year schedule for ISLO assessment.
What We Need to Do
Moving forward, the College needs to solidify the regular practice of assessment practice by following
through with the Program Assessment Plan (with necessary modifications). The implementation of
Weave will help regular record keeping and sharing with stakeholders.
Assessment is a continuous process. With the basic structure in place, the next focus is improving the
quality of assessment practice so that it will yield useful information for curricular decisions and
pedagogical improvements. For SAS programs, Assessment Fellows are charged to lead departmental
efforts to improve the Program Assessment Plans submitted by SAS Departments in Spring 2021.
Furthermore, some Departments are in the process of improving methods of measurement by developing
or refining rating rubrics and other instruments. Programs without discipline-specific accreditation are
in need of a regular system of reviewing and refining assessment practice beyond the Assessment
Fellows Program. For ISLO assessment, the need for documented instructions and pooling of
assessment instruments become stronger with the implementation of a five-phase cycle and multi-year
schedule that transcends the tenure of LEC membership.
Where We Want to Go
Meaningful assessment, i.e., assessment that is designed to gather useful information to improve student
learning experience and empower stakeholders, is considered the best practice assessment, according to
MSCHE and in the broader academic assessment community. As the very idea of assessment cycle
suggest, assessment is neither an end in itself nor an independent process, but resource for instructional
and curricular development. The goal of assessment is maximizing the usefulness of data (and actually
using them), not methodological perfection.
Meaningful assessment cannot be achieved by an externally-imposed, compliance-oriented approach.
While the starting point and bottom-line requirement may be meeting accreditation requirements, the
destination of efforts should be faculty-centered assessment in which assessment is embraced by faculty
as an indispensable resource for teaching and learning. Teaching and learning, curriculum building, and
assessment are interrelated components of a singular process of academic planning and delivery.
Optimal alignment of three components will create vibrant synergy in academic experience. Faculty
empowerment through assessment training and regular teaching-curriculum-assessment conversations
will cultivate such synergy.
Academic assessment is about gathering useful information about student learning experience. Direct
measurement of learning outcomes provides foundational data, but this data form is limited in scope. To
capture student learning experience more holistically, creative and multi-faceted assessment mixing
indirect and direct measurements will be desirable. Some Departments are already exemplifying this
approach by supplementing direct learning evaluation with surveys and interviews.

Co-Directors of Academic Assessment Report 2020-2021 - 35

What We Want to Avoid
Checkbox Assessment. While compliance may be the bottom line, treating academic assessment as a
box that needs to be checked off is counterproductive. Checkbox assessment, one might argue, is an act
of self-sabotage since it would make assessment bureaucratic busywork that wastes everyone’s time.
Focusing on the usefulness of assessment data and actually using them on the regular basis are keys to
avoid checkbox assessment.
Micro-obsessed Assessment. While methodological rigor improves the quality of assessment data,
methodological perfectionism would take the focus away from the usefulness of assessment. The goal of
assessment should be gathering good quality student learning data without becoming obsessive about
methodological details and being clear and transparent about the limitation of data.
What We Need/Want
The Assessment Fellows Program was created in preparation for the Assessment Coordinator System,
but the funding commitment for the system is yet to be made. The institutional commitment to the
Assessment Coordinator System is critical for the sustenance of regular, meaningful assessment practice
in SAS and SPS programs.
Creating a college-wide assessment calendar with reminders for key events will help facilitate regular
assessment activities and establishing academic assessment as a routine part of campus life. A multiyear academic assessment strategic plan created through a faculty-led process will help cultivate a
culture of assessment by generating a College-wide vision of assessment, setting common goals and
designing incremental processes to achieve them.
For ISLO assessment, annual training for LEC members to conduct ISLO assessment, “Closing the
Loop” activities and curricular improvements is needed. Since LEC is a committee of elected faculty
members, membership changes every year. Annual training and careful documentation are necessary to
carry out the five-phase assessment cycle for LEP.
Structurally, a faculty-led process for creating assessment policies and guidelines and supporting
assessment practices needs to be established. In Fall 2021, the Institutional Effectiveness Committee
(IEC) has been created as a College-wide entity that oversees and coordinates academic assessment. If
IEC is equipped with a bottom-up decision-making process that is capable of reflecting the will of a
broader group of faculty, the IEC could be a device of such a process.
The very essence of assessment is the honest evaluation of the current status and taking concrete steps to
make it better. Meaningful assessment, in this sense, is a courageous act of exposing one’s vulnerability
to make genuine engagement for improvements. Efforts to build a culture of trust and support, not that
of judgment and punishment, go hand in hand with fostering meaningful assessment. The fear of
possible misuse of assessment data by the administration as well as other faculty (especially by tenured
faculty against untenured faculty) has been mentioned repeatedly in faculty meetings, including Faculty
Senate meetings and Assessment Fellows meetings. Such fear drives the faculty away from meaningful
and truthful assessment. Efforts to establish institutional and collegial trust, as well as placing tangible
safeguards to prevent possible misuse of assessment data (e.g., anonymize assessment reports) will help
create an optimal space for meaningful assessment.
