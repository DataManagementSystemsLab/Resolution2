Senate Resolution

In Support of Civil Liberties at SUNY New Paltz
Whereas, the Old Westbury Faculty has been informed that the academic Administration
of SUNY-New Paltz, under Acting President Steven G Poskanzer, Has refused funding to
a proposed conference on Women and War, Peace and Revolution organized by the
Women’s Studies Program at the campus for October 19, 2002.

This is the first time that

funding has been denied to a program under the auspices of Women’s Studies.

In the recent past, the Trustees of the State University of New York attacked a conference

entitled “Revolting Behavior: The Challenges of Women’s Sexual Freedom” also
sponsored by Women’s Studies at New Paltz, producing a major investigation of all
academic programs at that campus, reviews of syllabi and the eventual removal of the
former president who had the courage to defend academic freedom against ideological
intrusions.The new Acting President of SUNY-New Paltz has decided that the proposed
conference on Women and War, Peace and Revolution is too idealogically imbalanced.
He fails to recognize that the general area of research into war and peace has moved to
center stage among women’s studies researchers and, in recognition of its importance, the
organizing theme of the 2004 American Historical Association convention in Washington
will be war and peace.
Therefore, be it resolved that

we, the Faculty Senate of SUNY College
freedom is put to the test when unpopular
withdrawal of funding for this conference
to the politics of some of the participants,

at Old Westbury recognizing that academic
views are expressed,and noting that the
has occurred in part in response to objections
as reported in the Chronicle of Higher

Education-Oct.4,2002:A15.

we, understanding that in any case, withdrawal of prior levels of funding in the context of
expression of unpopular views has a de facto chilling effect on the practice of academic
freedom, and conscious of the emergency need for funding caused by this action,urges
Acting President Proskanzer ‘s administration to review and reverse its decision and
restore funding for the conference on Women and War, Peace, and Revolution and
we, the Old Westbury Faculty commits ourselves to supporting the forthcoming
conference and invites everyone to attend and donate generously to Women’s
Studies/CAS. Women’s Studies Program
