Dear Mr. Llana:

Thank you for your letter of March 8" concerning the dormitory project at the
College of Old Westbury.
On February 12", the Dormitory Authority (Authority) informed the head of the
design/build team, The Vanderbilt Group LLC (Vanderbilt), that it had been terminated

from the project effective February 9". The Authority kad previously notified Vanderbilt
on December 5, 2000, of our intention to terminate the $27.9 million contract for the Old
Westbury project unless Vanderbilt could demonstrate that it should not be terminated.
We further attempted to negotiate an assignment of the contract to another firm, which
would have allowed construction to re-start at an earlier date. However, these talks were
unsuccessful, and Vanderbilt was terminated.
Since then, we have been working with Travelers Casualty & Surety, the
insurance company underwriting the performance bond guaranteeing completion of the
project. Through Travelers, we hope to reinvigorate the project to provide students at
SUNY Old Westbury with the dormitory rooms they need. I had hoped the conversations
with the surety would have progressed further by this time so that | could have responded
sooner to your letter.

Procurement of the design-build team for this project followed the Authority’s
policies and procedures to ensure competition and deliver quality construction within the
project budget. A professional committee of campus and Authority staff reviewed the
proposals and interviewed the teams considered to be offering the best proposals to meet

SUNY Old Westbury’s goals. The committee unanimously recommended Vanderbilt.
