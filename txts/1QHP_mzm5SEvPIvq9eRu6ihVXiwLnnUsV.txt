Resolution on the Creation of an Applied Learning Task Force

Whereas, the College has a long history of engagement with, commitment to, and support for activities that fall under the broad umbrella category of “Applied Learning,” and

Whereas, on April 22, 2016, the Faculty adopted the Liberal Education and America’s Promise (LEAP) program for the College’s institutional student learning outcomes (SLOs); LEAP is a national public advocacy and campus action initiative developed by the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) that aligns with the expectations of SUNY and the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE, or “Middle States”), which accredits the College, and

Whereas, the LEAP student learning outcomes include “Integrative and Applied Learning,” which aligns with SUNY’s program of Applied Learning; SUNY describes Applied Learning as “an educational approach whereby students learn by engaging in direct application of skills, theories and models. Students apply knowledge and skills gained from traditional classroom learning to hands-on and/or real-world settings, creative projects or independent or directed research, and in turn apply what is gained from the applied experience to academic learning. The applied learning activity can occur outside of the traditional classroom experience and/or be embedded as part of a course.” (https://www.suny.edu/applied-learning/about/definitions/), and

Whereas, SUNY definition of Applied Learning includes, but is not limited to, the following categories:

Cooperative Education

Internship—Credit Bearing/non-credit

Clinical Placement

Practicum

Service-Learning

Community Service

Civic Engagement

Creative Works

Research

Undergraduate Research (e.g., http://www.cur.org/)

Entrepreneurship (program, class, project)

Field Study

International and Domestic Travel/Exchange

and,

Whereas, the Faculty Senate has acted to investigate and promote Applied Learning as part of the College’s curriculum (e.g., Senate Resolutions of 12-2-2016, 5-19-2017), and

Whereas, the College’s efforts with respect to Applied Learning have been characterized by productive and cooperative involvement of Faculty, Students, and Administrators, and

Whereas, as a result of such collaboration, the College won a SUNY Performance Improvement Fund (PIF) grant, “Applied Learning:  Legacy Project of SUNY Old Westbury,” which aligns with the College’s Mission and the 2018-23 Strategic Plan, and 

Whereas, the PIF Grant includes funding to support student success in applied learning, including paid student internship opportunities, and

Whereas, the PIF Grant includes funding to support a full-time staff person (Applied Learning Coordinator) to create, among other responsibilities, an Applied Learning “clearinghouse of applied learning opportunities for students to support curricular placements in credit-bearing courses, and additional career explorations and skill developments through co-curricular experiences,” also identified as the Opportunities Campus Clearinghouse (OCC), and 

Whereas, the PIF Grant includes funding to support: collaboration between the Divisions of Academic Affairs and of Student Affairs for student career development; professional development of the faculty to improve Applied Learning integration in the overall, and 

Whereas, the existing entities created by the Faculty with respect to Applied Learning (i.e., the Applied Learning Campus Team, the Applied Learning Study Group, and the ad hoc Committee on Applied Learning) have fulfilled their roles, therefore

Be it Resolved that the Faculty Senate will create a Joint Faculty-Administrative Applied Learning Task Force (JF-AALTF) to be empaneled as soon as possible, and to exist for a period of 24 months from its creation, and be it

Further Resolved that the JF-AALTF be comprised of five (5) faculty members with experience and/or knowledge of Applied Learning best practices and existing policies (to be selected by the Faculty) and two (2) non-faculty ex officio members, one of whom will be the campus Liaison to SUNY for Applied Learning (or designee) and the other who will be the Applied Learning Coordinator whose initial hire was supported by the PIF grant funding, and be it

Further Resolved that the JF-AALTF will conduct appropriate research and engage in appropriate consultation with faculty, staff, and students in order to provide recommendations with respect to:

The process and criteria by which financial support for students available through the SUNY PIF will be made available and utilized (by such time as to meet the SUNY PIF schedule requirements)

The process and criteria by which the College will institutionalize the criteria for evaluating activities that are regularly incorporated into credit-bearing coursework for inclusion under one or more of the Applied Learning “tags” in Banner, and

The process and criteria by which the College will evaluate individual versions of credit-bearing courses for inclusion under one or more of the Applied Learning “tags” in Banner, and

The process and criteria by which the College will institutionalize the criteria for evaluating non-credit-bearing applied learning activities, and

The process and criteria for the assessment of Applied Learning SLOs within credit-bearing courses, and

The appropriate place of Applied Learning among expectations for students upon graduation, and

The most effective integration of Applied Learning opportunities into the existing structures of curriculum review and assessment.

and be it

Further Resolved that the JF-AALTF will report at least once each semester to the Faculty Senate, to the Division of Student Affairs, and to the Division of Academic Affairs on its progress towards these goals.
