Presidential Committees

In an effort to streamline and maintain a strategic interplay between presidential committees, the following represents a change
to the number and nature of SUNY Old Westbury’s presidential committees going forward. The first notable change is the creation
of a Residential College Committee, which represents a presidential and institutional priority that seeks an OW, mission-centric
approach towards a liberal arts education. The Residential College Committee functions as an umbrella committee for some prior
presidential committees and a few new ones. Each committee advises the president and executes its functions based upon
presidential support.
