Resolution on Adjunct Compensation for Pedagogical Development

Whereas the existing Distance Learning Policy1 requires that faculty complete training offered by the Office of Distance
Learning (ODL) in hybrid, blended, and online (asynchronous) instruction prior to teaching in any of these modalities,
and
Whereas for several years the ODL incentivized faculty training in distance modalities via the “Distance Stipend” and
“New Enhanced Distance Course Development” initiatives, which offered financial compensation for training and course
development, and
Whereas the stipend attached to these ODL initiatives served as an acknowledgement of the labor required to learn and
apply best practices in new modalities, and
Whereas the faculty recognizes the un- and under-paid labor of our adjunct colleagues in their efforts to contribute high
quality instruction to Old Westbury students, and
Whereas in Spring 2020 the Faculty Senate voted in support of compensating adjunct faculty for the immense workload
associated with transitioning courses to remote instruction, and
Whereas the faculty supports continuing opportunities to develop our teaching practice, and to engage with and learn
from colleagues on issues of pedagogy,

Therefore, be it resolved that the faculty encourages the College to explore and pursue opportunities to compensate
adjunct faculty for continued pedagogical development, for example, by offering financial incentives to participate in or
lead Innovation Laboratory or ODL workshops/training.

The Proposal approved by the Faculty Senate by unanimous consent on 4/9/2021.
