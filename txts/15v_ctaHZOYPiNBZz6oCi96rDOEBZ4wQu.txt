To Re-institute the Graduate Fellowship Incentive Program

DATE:

180th Plenary, October 18-20, 2018

LOCATION:

SUNY Binghamton

RESOLUTION #:

180-04-01

VOTE TALLY:

For: 36; Against: 4; Abstain: 4

RATIONALE:
WHEREAS proposal-writing is an important skill for graduate students to develop as the
foundation for entering leadership positions in the workforce, especially if they desire to become
professionals in academia; and
WHEREAS one of the Chancellor’s goals is to provide an individualized and adaptive education
to SUNY students; and
WHEREAS universities across the country commonly incentivize graduate students to submit
pre-doctoral training proposals as a means to increase the number of proposal submissions and
to increase extramural funding; and
WHEREAS graduate student fellowships allow SUNY faculty to reallocate their research funds
to support other graduate students or to purchase supplies and/or equipment; and
WHEREAS the SUNY University Faculty Senate passed a resolution in 2015 that called for the
establishment of a program to incentivize SUNY graduate students to write and submit grants
for graduate fellowship awards; and
WHEREAS the SUNY RF provided $40,000 over two years to operate a graduate incentive
program jointly administered with the SUNY UFS Graduate and Research Committee; and
WHEREAS the graduate incentive program was established and operated in 2015 and 2016 to
pay SUNY graduate students a maximum of $1000 each to attend grant-writing training and to
submit an NIH F30, F3, F30-Diversity, or F31-Diversity proposal for the December deadline; and
WHEREAS 164 SUNY graduate students attended proposal-writing training sessions and 40
students submitted proposals and received incentive awards; and
WHEREAS incentivized graduate students received NIH fellowship grants totaling $712,000,
which represents a 17–fold return on the initial investment of $40,000:

RESOLUTION:
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the University Faculty Senate recommends that the
SUNY Administration and the SUNY RF work together to provide funding and resources to
restart and maintain a Graduate Fellowship Incentive Program modeled after the 2015-2016
program; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that funding be adequate to expand the incentive program to
include other STEM graduate fellowship programs (e.g. NSF GRFP), additional NIH F30/F31
deadlines, and graduate fellowship programs in non-STEM fields.

BACKGROUND:
The 2015/2016 Graduate Incentive Program was created in response to a SUNY UFS
resolution early in 2015. That same resolution called for an assessment of the program after a
trial period. AS required by the resolution, an assessment report was prepared by the Graduate
Programs and Research Committee of the SUNY UFS in 2017-2018, and the report was
distributed to the UFS, SUNY RF, and the SUNY administration. The report detailed the
program, analyzed the outcomes of the incentive program, and made recommendations for the
incentives to be continued and expanded. Key excerpts from that report follow.
Excerpts from the 2018 Graduate Programs and Research Committee Report
Introduction
In January 2015, the SUNY University Faculty Senate passed a resolution prepared by the
Graduate Programs and Research (G&R) Committee entitled “Resolution for Incentives to
Support the Submission of STEM Graduate Research Grant Applications”. The resolution called
on SUNY and the SUNY RF to create an incentive program that would reward STEM graduate
students for submitting fellowship proposals. The resolution also called for an assessment of the
program after 2 years to see if it should be expanded to non-STEM fields.
A subcommittee of the UFS G&R committee working with the SUNY RF received a $40,000
budget to plan, implement, and evaluate the program for two years. The subcommittee then set
out to design the program within the parameters of the budget request. The planning activities
occurred in the spring of 2015 and implementation began in summer 2015.
2015-2016 Program Description
The 2015-2016 program had the following components:
1. Advertisement. An announcement was published and distributed through various channels.
The program announcement stated that the incentive would be as much as $1000, but the
actual amount depended on the number of qualified applicants.
2. Targeted programs. Initially the December 2015 deadline for the NIH F31 programs was
chosen for the incentive. In December 2016, the NIH F30 programs were also included after
based on concerns voiced by faculty from the Health Science sector.
3. Training. To qualify for the incentive, students had to complete grant-writing training.
4. Assessment. Training participants were asked to complete questionnaires after the training.
Incentive recipients were asked to respond to a survey.

Results
Over the two years the program was operated, 164 SUNY graduate students received proposalwriting training (Table 1). Of those 164 students, 40 submitted an F30 or F31 proposal by the
December deadline and received a $1000 incentive payment. The students receiving grants and
amounts are shown in Table 2.

Recommendations
1. The Incentive program should be re-funded by the RF/SUNY for FY 2018-19 and beyond.
2. A minimum of $60,000/year should be made available for the program to allow
incentivizing NSF GRFP submissions (due in October) in addition to NIH F31/F30 proposals.
NSF GRFP proposals are accepted for funding in Geoscience, Chemistry, Psychology, Social
Sciences, STEM Education, Math, Engineering, Physics, Biology, and Computer Science. The
NIH program only supports biomedical research.
3. If funding is available, the NIH F30/F31 incentive should be extended to include another
submission deadline each year (April or August).
4. A $1000 incentive seems to be adequate to motivate doctoral-level students to submit
proposals, so this level of should be maintained.
5. The grant-writing training needs to include very specific information for each of the funding
programs incentivized as well as general instruction on grant writing.
6. Advertising for the program needs to be improved. Students, faculty, and departments all
need to be aware of the program.
7. The joint UFS/RF administration of the program worked well and should be retained.
