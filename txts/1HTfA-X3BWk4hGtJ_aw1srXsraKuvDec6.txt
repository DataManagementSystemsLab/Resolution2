FROM:

University Faculty Senate

RE:

Resolution on Rational Fiscal Policy

DATE:

January 18, 2002

RATIONALE
WHEREAS

the economic and scientific competitiveness of New York State is dependent

on an educated citizenry, and

WHEREAS the quality of that education is linked to appropriate state support, and
WHEREAS SUNY is committed to providing broad access to quality state supported
higher education, and
WHEREAS

there is a clear indication that greater numbers of New York State students

will seek a SUNY

education, and

WHEREAS the lack of a long range funding policy makes financial planning difficult for
students and their parents, SUNY campuses, and the State of New York,

WHEREAS the lack of a long range funding policy threatens continuation of excellence

in teaching and research that exists within the SUNY system, and hence long term ability
to compete with other universities;
RESOLUTION
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Chancellor, working with the University

Faculty Senate, governmental bodies, and other appropriate constituencies, develop a
long term, rational fiscal policy to include increased state support and to address such

factors as enrollment growth and inflation to ensure the quality of public higher education
in New York State.
