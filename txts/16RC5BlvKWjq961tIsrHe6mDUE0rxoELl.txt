In 300  or  fewer  words,  describe  the  proposed  program,  including  its
purpose, content, structure, and duration.
   The proposed degree of Bachelor Science in Economics will enable students
at Old Westbury to earn  a  degree  in  Economics  in  an  interdisciplinary
Liberal Arts program that focuses on politics, economics, and  law.  Besides
offering a new degree option to liberal  arts  and  business  students,  the
Economics Degrees  will  expand  the  elective  choices  available  to  both
Politics, Economics & Law and Business majors.
   The 48 credit B.S. program in economics requires students to take math up
to Calculus  I,  five  core  courses  in  economics  and  statistics;  three
interdisciplinary courses in political economy and thought; and three  upper
division electives. Students  will  also  be  required  to  either  take  an
Econometrics or do  an  independent  quantitative  based  research  project.
Students can group their three upper division electives in  either  economic
policy,  international  economic  theory  and  global  economic  history  or
monetary theory.

                Optional, Illustrative Questions to Consider:
       For other SUNY campuses responding to the Program Announcement

● Do you have a similar or related program?   ●What has been your
experience with the program?    ●Would the introduction of this program
have any effect, positive or negative, on your institution?   If so, please
specify.   ●Do you perceive a need for this kind of program?   ●Does the
program offer an opportunity for articulation or inter-institutional
cooperation?

Your response must be in writing, from your President, and addressed to the
President of the proposing campus, with a copy to the SUNY Provost at
program.review@.suny.edu.

Currently the College of  Arts  and  Sciences  offers  an  interdisciplinary
degree in Politics, Economics and Law (PEL). SUNY College  at  Old  Westbury
was one of the pioneers in interdisciplinary  studies  dating  back  to  the
late 1960s. Over the past several decades the academic emphasis in the  Arts
and Sciences has oscillated between an  appreciation  for  interdisciplinary
insight to more of an emphasis of disciplinary literacy and application  and
back  again.  The  College   has   always   maintained   the   priority   of
interdisciplinary curricula and the program of PEL will continue to do so.

This is  an  excellent  program  for  students  looking  to  continue  their
education in the areas  of  law,  teacher  education,  business  and  policy
studies. Its emphasis is to provide students a rigorous  background  in  the
mainstream disciplines  of  politics,  economics  while  also  offering  the
student the historical and institutional  insight  of  the  intersection  of
these areas of society.  Students  gain  the  conceptual  knowledge  of  the
discipline but also how these areas affect each other over time  and  across
cultures. The interests and skills and interests required  are  varied  from
historical, critical thinking, analytical  writing  and  reasoning  to  some
quantitative problem solving. The program has added programs in the area  of
Industrial and Labor Relations  which  has  been  very  successful  offering
students’ career paths in labor relations, human resources and law.

However increasingly students come to us who  are  not  sure  they  want  to
commit to a business degree but  who  have  interests  in  the  economy  and
skills which are weighted more in the mathematical and  quantitative  areas.
Each year students who thought they might want to do a  business  curriculum
come to us looking for a  degree  with  more  of  an  emphasis  in  economic
related areas that could provide them  a  path  to  law,  public  policy  or
business graduate studies in finance and economics. We are looking  to  take
our economist resources and combine them with some of the resources  serving
business and math departments to provide a degree in  economics.  The  focus
will emphasize more intensive economic  theory  and  application  and  serve
students with more  mathematics  and  quantitative  skill  capabilities.  We
don’t anticipate adding any additional  staff  but  utilizing  our  existing
faculty and many courses we already  offering  bundling  a  curriculum  that
expands the options of our students.


The Economics degree will promote the College’s goals in five  ways.  First,
it will enhance the College’s social science curriculum  by  adding  to  the
quality and quantity of course  offerings  in  economics.  Second,  it  will
provide students interested in a quantitative  major  option  an  additional
choice. Third, it will fill  gaps  in  the  college’s  course  offerings  by
providing interested non-majors access to intermediate  and  upper  division
courses in economics. Specifically students interested  in  minors  such  as
environmental studies, public policy  and  global  studies  will  have  more
offerings to fill out their study and skills.

Fourth, it will enrich the course offerings  for  the  majors  in  Politics,
Economics & Law and Industrial Labor Relations majors as  well  as  Business
majors, who will now have access to a broad array  of  economics  electives.
And fifth with minorities underrepresented in the economics  profession  the
College of Old Westbury’s student body can offer an  opportunity  for  these
students to travel down the path to economic related professions.

Procedure for Program Announcements (PA)

   1. SCOPE.  A SUNY campus must send a PA to the SUNY Provost at
      program.review@suny.edu before submitting a proposal for a new program
      leading to an undergraduate degree.  Unless requested by the SUNY
      Provost, a PA is not required for a program leading to an
      undergraduate certificate, for a new program being created by
      combining existing registered programs (e.g., multi-award programs
      and/or multi-institution programs), or for a new program being created
      from a track, specialization, or concentration in a registered
      program.

   2. SUNY PROVOST’S REVIEW.  The SUNY Provost’s Office reviews each PA for
      accuracy and completeness as well as for substantive issues, such as
      alignment with campus mission and SUNY policy, and requests changes
      when needed.

   3. PUBLICATION FOR COMMENTS.  Once a PA is acceptable to the SUNY
      Provost, it is announced on the SUNY Program Review listserv in a
      weekly Program Review Update, which starts a 30-day intra-SUNY comment
      period.  The listserv includes all campus presidents, chief academic
      officers, and others upon request.  The PA enables other SUNY campuses
      – particularly those with experience with related programs – to
      provide information to the proposing campus that can be used to
      construct a sound program proposal.

   4. COMMENTS FROM OTHER CAMPUSES.  The President of each interested campus
      must send comments within 30 days of a PA’s publication in the Program
      Review Update to the President of the proposing campus, with a copy to
      the Provost at program.review@suny.edu.  Comments may include advice
      and suggestions about possible articulation opportunities, enrollment
      trends in related programs, and opportunities for cooperation, as well
      as concerns or objections.

   5. FOLLOWING THE COMMENT PERIOD.  Once the 30-day comment period for a PA
      ends, and any concerns and/or objections have been resolved, the
      campus may prepare a full proposal for the SUNY Provost and, when
      required, begin the external evaluation process.


   6. EXPIRATION.  A PA expires one year after its publication in the
      Program Review Update.   If the proposing campus does not submit a
      program proposal to the SUNY Provost before a PA expires, the campus
      must submit another PA to start the process again.
