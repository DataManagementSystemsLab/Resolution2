IT Shared Governance Study: Executive Summary
Instructional technology has nearly universal importance to teaching. Stable network connection
and reliably functional classroom technology are essential, but these basic needs are often unmet.
Almost all respondents to the Faculty Survey reported routinely using some instructional technology.
Meanwhile, over 40% indicated technology in regular smart classrooms does not meet their teaching
needs. Nearly 70% of survey respondents experienced IT problem in the first several weeks of F19, and
about 40% of these problems inhibited their teaching in multiple class periods.
Overall, faculty perceive the problems in instructional technology to be both systemic and fiscal.
The faculty recognizes efforts made by individual ITS staff. Narrative comments from the survey and
Faculty Rep Interviews acknowledge that IT problems are primarily due to the lack of resources and
staffing or policy and purchasing decisions, and the situation is beyond the control of individual staff.
Confidence in the current model of IT shared governance is low, both among faculty at large and
among those who served on IT shared governance committees. Eighty three percent of survey
respondents indicated that they do not have a voice in IT governance. Sixty nine percent do not feel that
IT policies at the College are developed in a fair and transparent way and 71% do not feel that the
allocation of IT resources is fair and transparent. These sentiments are stronger among tenure-track
faculty. Faculty representatives who have served on IT shared governance committees felt they were
unable to play a meaningful role because 1) committee meetings are not the site of decision-making, 2)
the meeting agendas are dominated by administrative issues rather than pedagogical concerns, and 3)
there is neither time nor an effective mechanism for representatives to consult with a larger faculty body.
The lack of a culture of respect at meetings was also identified as an obstacle to meaningful participation,
particularly by women and untenured faculty reps.

Ineffective IT shared governance hinders teaching and the utilization of IT resources. Narrative
comments in the survey and interviews pointed to multiple instances of technological mismatch, where
new technology was incompatible with pedagogical needs and/or with existing technology. Faculty Rep
Interviews revealed that the target users were not effectively involved in the decision-making; in cases
where they were consulted, faculty learned their feedback had been ignored only after the technology had
been installed or policy implemented. These technological mismatches result in the underutilization of
new technology, and a negative impact on teaching. Furthermore, both interview and survey respondents
noted cases of unutilized IT resources due to the lack of communication and/or instruction.
IT policies that are misaligned with faculty needs hinders essential functions of the faculty and may
heighten security risks. Both survey respondents and faculty representatives interviewed noted that a
recent policy that deprives faculty administrative privileges to their college-issued laptop hinders daily
functionality, especially in the context of limited tech support. When college-provided IT resources are
inadequate to their needs, the faculty tend to sacrifice components of teaching or resort to using personal
resources; 13% of survey respondents reported they had “given up” on using a college-issued personal
device. If depriving administrative privileges turns more faculty to personally-owned devices it could
potentially have an adversary impact on security.
Forms of IT shared governance vary among SUNY campuses, but clear mechanism for faculty
input with explicit connections to the Faculty Senate appears fundamental to all models.
Transparent communication with stakeholders and aligning IT policies with user needs are
generally considered key components of IT governance best practice.

IT Shared Governance Study: Recommendations
Based on findings from the study, the IT Shared Governance Study Task Force recommends following
actions:
1. The College will replace the IT Governance Committee with a more effective model.
2. The Faculty Senate will coordinate with the Administration to form a joint faculty-admin task
force to design an improved model of the IT governance by a clearly specified deadline.
3. The Faculty Senate and the Administration will consider recommendations from the task force in
spirit of shared governance and work together for an appropriate and timely implementation.

The IT Shared Governance Study Task Force recommends that the new system of IT shared governance
will:
 Implement a transparent and collaborative decision-making process in IT policies,
purchasing, and resource allocations
 Build in time and mechanisms for meaningful consultation with stakeholders prior to
major IT decisions
 Assign clear roles and responsibilities to committees and representatives
 Use common democratic process in meetings, e.g., circulate agendas and minutes in a
timely manner, articulate action plan items and follow up on them
 Consciously foster culture of respect in meetings
 Create a mechanism that better aligns IT policies with pedagogical needs
 Built in a mechanism that routinely gathers faculty input on IT issues
 Identify ways to recognize and support bottom up faculty innovations and initiatives
 Consider creating a tech incubator with an iterative process to pilot new instructional
technology and test faculty initiatives
 Institute a system that promotes accountability and evidence-based policy-making
 Monitor the use of new technology after implementation and make the data accessible to
stakeholders
 Utilize assessment data and formal faculty input to reflect on past technology decisions and
drive future resource allocation
 Study and build on best practices for shared IT governance at other institutions
 Establish the faculty governance structure that empowers those who represent the faculty on
IT shared governance committees
 Consider creating a standing committee whose focus is to advocate IT needs of faculty

I. Faculty Representative Interviews: Methodology and Overview
During September and October 2019, committee members conducted interviews with nine faculty
members who had participated in either the IT Governance Committee (ITGC) or Technology Strategic
Plan Committee (TSPC) process since 2014. After completing a written pre-interview questionnaire to
gauge their level of involvement in either or both of these forms of IT shared governance, subjects
participated in interviews, either in person or by phone. Interviews lasted from 20 minutes to 1 hour, and
interviews were used to follow up on the written responses to the pre-interview questions. Detailed
interview notes were kept. Verbatim quotes were recorded as notes, and interviewees had the
opportunity to review these records for accuracy. Interviewees were assured that their identities would
be confidential, and identifying content was redacted from this report to preserve anonymity. Quotes
provided in this report come from both the pre-interview written responses and interview notes, and are
illustrative, not exhaustive.
All faculty interviewed were careful to acknowledge the challenges faced by Old Westbury’s IT
department. Most noted a lack of staffing and problems with sustainability of technology on campus as
systemic issues, and that IT staffing and college budget were obvious constraints that may be beyond
any one person’s control. Several interviewees stated that they felt individuals were “trying their best”
within the system. Some noted that every tech decision will result in some challenges and mixed
reactions from faculty, staff and administrators. Additionally, most interviewees described strong
personal relationships with individuals in ITS, and admired their ability to maintain positive attitudes
despite challenges. For example, a number of interviewees commented on the CIO’s upbeat attitude,
openness to innovation, and awareness of other institutions.
Regarding IT shared governance, interviews revealed multiple areas of challenges. Interviewees noted
that the limited democratic decision-making process at meetings and a weak mechanism of faculty
representation severely limit the efficacy of shared governance. Interviewees reported that ITGC
meetings are where decisions are reported rather than made, and a sense that there is no room for them
to make meaningful contributions. Faculty representatives also reported feeling ill-equipped to represent
the faculty since 1) there is no time allotted for them to bring an issue back to the faculty body and get
their input, and 2) there is no clear system to inform them of the collective will of the faculty. The lack
of a culture of respect at meetings was also identified as an obstacle to meaningful participation,
particularly by female and junior faculty reps.
Ineffective IT shared governance comes at fiscal and pedagogical costs. Interviewees pointed out some
of new IT resources are underutilized because the faculty do not know how to use them (or do not know
the existence of them) or because they are not aligned with pedagogical needs. From the faculty point of
view, these teaching-tech mismatches were predictable; respondents were confident that they could have
been avoided if stakeholders had been effectively and meaningfully consulted prior to decision-making
and implementation. It was also noted that it is difficult to gain faculty buy-in when IT decisions that
substantially affect the faculty are made without their input. Furthermore, when IT decisions are made
without user input, resulting policies could be myopic, damaging, and arguably ineffective. For example,
multiple interviewees expressed concerns with the recent decision to deprive faculty users of
administrator privileges to college-issued laptops as one of these myopic policies.

ITSGS Report: Faculty Representative Interviews - I 1

Interviewees offered a number of suggestions to improve the effectiveness of IT shared governance.
These suggestions could be summarized as: 1) to enhance transparency in communication and
incorporate pedagogical needs in IT policy-making, 2) to monitor the use of new technology after
implementation, share the data with stakeholders and use the data to inform future IT policies, 3) to
create a system within the faculty governance structure that advocates for IT needs among the faculty
and inform faculty representatives, and 4) to strengthen democratic decision-making process in
committee meetings.

1. IT Shared Governance: Three Areas of Challenges
Interviews reveal multi-faceted challenges to IT shared governance on campus. Three areas of
challenges emerged from faculty representative interviews: decision-making processes in the IT
Governance Committee (ITGC) and Technology Strategic Plan Committee (TSPC); the mechanism of
faculty representation; and culture of respect at committee meetings.
a. Decision-Making Process in Committees
The Lack of Clear and Democratic Meeting Process, Objectives, and Roles
Everyone interviewed who had participated in the ITGC noted that a lack of structure, unclear process,
and lack of accountability. For example, interviewees noted that “The charge and function of the
committee was not clear,” and that “Information shared was vague, sometimes inaccurate and also
changed [from meeting to meeting].”
Many concerns were raised about a lack of clear, democratic meeting process at ITGC.
● “Agenda would go out…with no opportunity to solicit faculty input.”
● “no election of a chair”
● “we rarely voted on anything until some members pushed for concrete next steps”
● “minutes were sometimes taken but not always”
Those who participated in TSPC shared similar concerns about the meeting process.
Everyone interviewed who participated in the TSPC reported a process that was disorganized, unclear,
ineffective and incomplete:
● “There was no agenda.”
● “there is no process”
● “There was no post meeting follow up.”
● “Materials were not shared in advance for review prior to the meeting discussions.”
The Lack of Decision-Making at Meetings
Interviewees indicated that the IT committees they participated in did not function as decision-making
bodies, and that faculty representatives are functionally excluded from real decision-making. Most
interviewed noted that decisions seemed to be made outside of the ITGC meetings.
● “never asked for our input”
● “outcomes at the meetings felt predetermined”
● “It felt like decisions were happening at the Cabinet level that were influencing the discussion.”
Most ITGC reps indicated that their participation in ITGC was a “waste of time” because they felt that
they had no real input in the decision making. Many noted that meetings were a place to report
decisions, not to make decisions. Some noted that the faculty were “used” for a token representation.
● “I couldn’t see any direct benefit as faculty in my participation with the IT gov committee.”
● “It functioned like a live-action newsletter with [the CIO] reporting decisions, not consulting.”

“There is often the idea that faculty are involved in decision making but they really are not, or
just a few people are involved not as faculty representatives.”
“[The CIO] would often report having consulted with faculty or faculty committees when this
was not accurate, for example stating that he had consulted TLRC when he had not.”
“It was not an advisory meeting. We had no real input or influence. It was a reporting
mechanism.”
“My perception of the dynamic in the room was that there were admin processes in place and we
came in at a point when these processes were already the norm of operations. My sense was that
the impact that we had was not great. I didn’t think that we were impacting decisions in a
significant way.”
“By the time that things come to the committee, a lot of the decisions have already been made.
Just announcing decisions, no consultation or advisory role.”
“It feels as though the faculty are a token.”
“Faculty is used as a prop.”

Faculty reps who served on TSPC reported that they did not understand their role on the committee or
how to engage the process, and saw no clear outcomes from the meetings.
● “My IT strategic plan subcommittee only met one time and there was no follow up.”
● “I went to one or two meetings. I have no idea what happened with that committee and I didn’t
really understand what it was about.”
● “We didn’t complete the task/ charge.”
● “I honestly had no idea what we were doing or why we were meeting, and then the meetings just
stopped being called, with no final output that I am aware of.”
Admin-Centered Agenda Setting
Focus of the ITGC meetings was reported as broad or focused on administrative concerns around tech,
leaving no place for addressing day to day tech issues faced by faculty, no room for interdisciplinary
planning and space to nurture innovative use of tech in the classroom.
● “meetings had an overly broad vision”
● “Tech for the business operations side of the college are the focus of most meetings.”
● “When pressing, day-to-day, problems were brought up, they rarely stayed a focus in the
conversation.”
● “Most things brought to the meetings had to do with the future direction of IT management
(workflow, consultants, global structural changes at the top of the org).”
● “There should be more emphasis on addressing the faculty as well as the admin in the meetings.”
● “There should be more emphasis on what is being considered, context of what is happening at
other SUNYs, etc.”

ITSGS Report: Faculty Representative Interviews - I 4

Many felt frustrated that there didn’t seem to be a place to address the day-to-day or pedagogical
concerns of faculty. Faculty reported bringing up specific problems (such as issues in specific computer
labs) and being told “that is not the purview of the governance committee.”
● “There was very little discussion about how day-to-day things affect faculty. Is there a place for
this discussion/ faculty input?”
● “At one point we had a conversation about what the committee was to be about. [The CIO]
stated it wasn’t about day-to-day problems but others disagreed.”

b. Mechanism of Faculty Representation
Another area of challenge in IT shared governance emerged from the interviews is the mechanism of
faculty representation. Interviewees indicated that the current system of faculty representation may not
be sufficient for representatives to adequately represent the faculty body. Their concerns are threefold;
1) there is no time allotted for representatives to bring the issue back to the faculty body and consult
with them in decision-making processes at committees, 2) there is no mechanism within the faculty
governance that effectively informs representatives of the collective will of the faculty, and 3) the
system of appointing representatives is unclear. Not having an IT-related standing committee that is
linked to faculty senate makes these representatives disfranchised. Some representatives noted that there
is “no democratic appointment process,” while Task Force members understand that the system of ITGC
appointment changed over time and this impression may be limited to a particular time period. Of great
concern to most faculty who served on the ITGC was that there was no time nor effective process for
them to report back to faculty at large, consult with faculty at large or bring in wider faculty input.
● “Communication could be more transparent and formalized. How do reps communicate with
faculty? How do faculty report to reps?”
● “As a rep I don’t get any input from faculty. It is confusing about how faculty can communicate
what they want or issues to IT.”
● “A new way is needed for faculty to give input: online forum, online dialog, message board,
dialog, see other faculty comments, better communication.”
● “When we had events designed to solicit faculty input, there was no mechanism for actually
collecting – or analyzing – that input. So we had an event to demo technology for the library
classrooms, for example, but no one ever told us what we should think about in evaluating
options or asked us what we thought. It was all for show.”
● “We are not able to really represent faculty or input decision. There is never a mechanism to
collect feedback.”
● “I had no way to represent faculty, as there was no time for consultation with Senate or
departments prior to decisions. There was no formal structure in place for me to serve as a
representative of faculty at large.”

c. Culture of Respect

ITSGS Report: Faculty Representative Interviews - I 5

Both ITGC and TSPC representatives expressed concerns that they or their colleagues were not
respected by everyone at the table. This concern was particularly evident among women and junior
faculty.
● “Input is often minimized by correcting small technical inaccuracies in language, while
dismissing the spirit of the feedback.”
● “In my observation gender seemed to have an observable impact on how individuals were treated
– who was interrupted, dismissed, given air time, deferred to…of course, the room was almost
all men, so it’s hard to say.”
● “dismissive of comments of faculty”
● “The culture of ITS and admin heavy committees can be very masculine.”

ITSGS Report: Faculty Representative Interviews - I 6

2. Cost of Ineffective Shared Governance
a. Underutilization of Resources and Teaching-Tech Mismatch
A number of concerns were raised about the lack of communication and coordination with the faculty
when new instructional technology is implemented. Specific examples cited were: 3D printing, the new
library collaborative classrooms, the new VR room, and the iPads in the library.
● ‘It did not seem that faculty response was being taken into consideration when future plans were
being discussed.”
● “IT purchases equipment without coordinating with faculty to discuss priorities.”
● “IT purchases technology without informing faculty.”
● “Ask faculty what they want and how they plan to use it before purchasing.”
● “I was omitted from the process. Technology just shows up without my involvement.”
Without proper knowledge and training, faculty are unable to make full use of available resources. If
faculty are not informed of the existence of technological resources, they are unable to plan to use them.
If these investments are not embedded in pilot programs or building on existing pedagogical needs,
resources may be underutilized. Without prior consultation with the faculty, a mismatch between new
technology and pedagogical needs is likely to occur. Furthermore, without assessment of these
investments, the College is not using the lessons from the past to guide future investments.
● “ITS brings technology to the campus but never tells anyone”
● “We bring in shiny new technology without consulting and no review of how the tech is used.”
● “The technology could languish without being used.”
● “There should be a follow-up on how the new technology is working and how the end users feel
about its use.”
 “Where was the faculty input in the library collaborative classrooms, VR room, iPads for the
library, etc? Can we do a better job of soliciting faculty input prior to these investments? Can
teaching and learning be central to tech decision making?”
 “Most of the time we find out about things after they have already happened.
 “New tech should come with a plan for piloting it in teaching and learning…and some
accountability around the use of new tech.”
 “We should consider teaching and learning as central to IT decisions.”
A number of those interviewed discussed frustrations around the VR room, as one such example.
Faculty who teach with VR reported not having been consulted in the design of the room. One
respondent raised concerns that the VR room was designed to replace hands-on learning - for example,
science lab practicums - without consulting departments or faculty about this major shift in pedagogy.
● “The process for the VR room did not go through our normal departmental decision-making
process / hierarchy.”
● “I teach VR but I didn’t know anything about this room. I bring in my own equipment, headset,
etc.”
● The new VR lab seems to be for viewing content, not making content. I’m not sure if it will be
useful for my teaching of VR.
ITSGS Report: Faculty Representative Interviews - I 7

b. Disengaged or Resistant Constituency
When the faculty is uninformed of and/or excluded from a decision-making process, or their input is not
reflected in final decisions, a new IT policy may be perceived as an imposition by the administration.
One interviewee noted that failure to bring “major IT decisions that affect everyone” to Faculty Senate is
an obstacle to creating faculty buy in. Another noted, that the process was “a complete waste of time and
energy” that “shatter[ed] any expectation I had of a functional bureaucracy.” While a third reported, “It
felt like a total waste of my time. I felt like I was there so someone could say that faculty were involved
in the process, but I had no real participation or influence over the process.” This frustration may result
in faculty disengaging and pulling back from important service work.

c. Myopic IT Policies
When policies are created without user input, they tend to be myopic in approach and could result in
unintended damages. For example, many interviewees reported concerns over the recent decision to take
admin privileges away from faculty as one of those myopic policies. While faculty understand the need
for security, they hoped for clearer communication and a solution that would not pose an obstacle to
their teaching and research. Some were concerned with the decision-making process and lack of
transparency. Others were concerned with the effect this decision was having on their teaching and
research.
● “This committee [ITGC] was not part of the conversation to remove admin privileges from
faculty computers.”
● “Taking away admin privileges has been a real burden to faculty who work in the labs and teach
tech and is having an adverse effect on our ability to teach with emerging technology.”
● “In the past, professors had admin access and could fix small things ourselves in the teaching
labs.,, now that we have no admin access…it is affecting our ability to teach.”
● “We need to be able to install updates and plugins within 24-hours or even in class/ the same
day, as tech is always changing. We can’t wait weeks or months for tickets to be resolved.”
● “Faculty should also have admin login for our own laptops. We can’t do our jobs without this
access over the tools we use to teach.”
● “We use a lot of free tools for our tech and we can’t download them to the computers now.”
● “We can’t use tools in real time because we don’t have admin privileges to do it anymore. This
makes it hard as a researcher, this doesn’t promote innovation.”
● “No consistent help from IT. Tickets are submitted, but might take a long period of time to
resolve or not be resolved. In the meantime, there could be many students suffering the outage...
If IT wishes to maintain their monopoly on administrative accounts then IT should respond
quickly.”

3. Suggestions for Improvement
A number of suggestions for improvement were offered by interviews. These suggestions are around
four general themes: 1) enhance transparency in communication and incorporate pedagogical needs in
IT policy-making, 2) monitor the use of new technology after implementation, share the data with
stakeholders and use the data to inform future IT policies, 3) strengthen a system within the faculty
governance structure that advocates for IT needs among the faculty and inform faculty representatives,
and 4) establish democratic decision-making process in committee meetings.
a. Enhance Transparent Communication and Pedagogy-Centered IT Planning
Interviewees urged for more transparency and better communication. Some specifically suggested the
use of technology and asynchronous tools to enhance communication and faculty participation in
decision making:
● “Online documentation”
● “Strategic plan for IT could be shared online for faculty with a way for faculty to provide
feedback on those plans”
● “Written notes - minutes from the meetings should be shared and posted for all faculty to
review”
● “website or form for faculty or anyone to send messages to reps about what they are interested
in/ faculty needs around IT to the campus, etc.”
● “A formal website or form to communicate with faculty reps”
● “Transparent open communication and dialog that is asynchronous”
● “Use online voting for faculty input. For example: Pros and cons of email [G-mail vs. Office
365] with a strong recommendation from IT, followed by a faculty vote via email.”
Many interviewees called for more “bottom up” support and innovation of instructional technology.
They were concerned that there is no place to meaningfully address how technology affects our teaching
in the current structure. They also called for more sustainability, support and tracking of new
technology. Many saw a need to support pilots, and to learn from, support, and build on what faculty are
already doing with technology. Many suggested we look for ways to improve and support
interdisciplinary planning and collaboration around tech innovation and resources, for more cohesive
support. In order for IT policies to reflect pedagogical needs on campus, continuous monitoring of
instructional technology and dialog with the faculty is indispensable.
● “Promote interdepartmental collaboration, broaden our impact in our tech investments.”
● “Transparent, collaborative budget process/cycle that would allow departments to plan for
refreshing outdated equipment and even growth. Coordination of tech planning across
departments, schools, and divisions to avoid unnecessary competition or duplication of effort.”
● “More collaboration results in more external funding / greater interdepartmental impact”
● “There seems to be a need for interdisciplinary collaboration around tech.”
● “Acquisition of new software and technology needs to be more transparent.”
● “Training and support of new software and technology is needed. Can we have a more robust
and maintained online description, training, FAQ, or ‘how to’ for new technologies?”
ITSGS Report: Faculty Representative Interviews - I 9

● “Follow up on new IT initiatives is needed such as user satisfaction surveys.”
● “Maybe there is a need for a scholarly tech-based forum where we are really trying to
accomplish buy-in from the faculty/ stakeholders.”
● “Incubator forum where people can pilot things and get support.”
● “Perhaps a more collaborative and informal forum focused on projects that will improve our
teaching and research would be a better use of our time.”

b.

Monitor Tech Usage, Share the Data with Stakeholders and Use the Data in IT
Policy Making

Interviewees also pointed out a need for more formal assessment, for example analyzing help desk
tickets, identifying recurring issues, following up to determine whether issues have been truly resolved,
and assessing new tech investments.
● “Are common ticket issues being resolved on a systemic level? How are we using help desk
ticket data to identify and solve tech problems on campus?”
● “Are we tracking how much tech is being used?”
● “Create a more formal way to collect faculty feedback and report back.”
● Could planning be more “strategic?” Can we use some of the abundance of data available to
help guide us?
● “If an investment is made that is not well used or not effective, how do we learn from this and
adjust future decision making based on this info?”

c. Strengthen a Function that Advocates for Faculty IT Needs within the Faculty
Governance Structure
Most interviewed wondered how IT governance could be better woven into our existing governance
structures, specifically Faculty Senate and department hierarchies. Some suggested a need for a different
type of committee, others suggested TLRC might take on this additional role, while others felt adding
more faculty reps and formalizing the process of the existing committee might help.
● “In theory, whatever the role of this committee, it should be structured similarly to faculty
senate: announcement of what is being considered; options to be considered; time to reach out to
whoever one is representing; identify the stakeholders, reach out to them with enough notice that
allows consultation and participation; bring that input to the decision making; make decisions
collaboratively in the meetings.”
● “Have a process. Write the process down. Build time for consultation with stakeholders into that
process.”
● “It would be helpful for IT to keep faculty involved in future developments. Possible changes
could be brought to the Faculty Senate for discussion. Changes to IT implementation could
possibly be voted on.”

ITSGS Report: Faculty Representative Interviews - I 10

There was also concern that we not overextend faculty and calls to consider how existing committees
and structures could support this work.
● “I would be cautious to not develop more process when we don’t have enough senior faculty
willing to serve.”
● “Maybe the TLRC can be more involved with tech that impacts teaching and research /
innovation in teaching and research? We might not need to create yet another committee.”
● “The department structure is junior faculty raises issues to chair, [then the] chair and department
advocate. That is our existing democratic structure. Department process should be followed
[when making tech decisions].”

d. Establish a Democratic Decision-Making Process in Meetings
Interviewees suggested that ensuring time for faculty representatives to bring the item back to the
faculty and consult with them and incorporating normative meeting practices (e.g. clear agenda,
identifying and following up action items, and democratic agenda setting) would help establish effective
consultation.
● “Use Roberts, or anybody's, Rules in the meetings. Elect the committee chair. Have a non-ITS
co-chair. Take minutes. Identify action items. Follow up on action items.”
● “Information should be presented at the meetings in a way that is clear and accessible to
everyone on the committee.”
● “Decisions that are going to affect everyone should be the main focus of these meetings.”
● “There should be more clarity and transparency about what is coming down the pike around IT
decisions.”
● “Bring major decisions directly to Senate for feedback and a vote.”

2. ITGC Charge of the Committee
(Undated material provided by an interviewee)
In spring 2014, the College established an IT Governance Committee (ITGC), which has held monthly
meetings since March 2015. The ITGC is charged to serve as an advisory body to the College
President on all IT matters. After the initial staggered appointments, subsequent terms of service will be
for two years. Beginning in 2016, and in response to concerns raised by the faculty, the faculty
members of the ITGC will be nominated by the Faculty Senate for appointment by the President (see
Appendix 2.2 the initial composition of the ITGC). The IT Governance Committee structure establishes
the strategic, operational and technical decision-making processes related to employing technology
which enables the College to achieve its Mission and objectives. The ITCG, in conjunction with the CIO
and the staff of Information Technology Services (ITS) will:
• Identify and recommend meaningful and innovative use of existing and emerging technologies that
enable and support learning, teaching and the administrative operations across the College.
• Assist in the development of the College’s long range technology plan and ensure that the technology
plan is in alignment with the College’s Mission, strategic plan goals and SUNY’s strategic initiatives,
where appropriate.
• Identify campus-wide Information Technology (IT) priorities and recommend strategies for funding
these Priorities.
• Provide guidance regarding the review, evaluation, ranking and scheduling for implementation of
impending IT initiatives, projects and Technologies.
• Ensure that significant opportunities for utilizing technology are considered, that significant technology
related risks are addressed, and that the use of College IT resources is optimized.
• Define metrics to measure IT’s performance and the return on the considerable technology
investments the College has made.
• Recommend, implement and disseminate relevant IT policies and procedures to the College
Community.

I. Faculty Survey Key Findings
The Impact of Instructional Technology on Teaching
 For the faculty at Old Westbury, IT resources are indispensable to teaching. Almost all
respondents routinely use some instructional technology (See Figure 2). A vast majority reported
that classroom technology, campus Wi-Fi, and college-provided computing devices are
important or critically important to their teaching (See Figure 3).
 Unreliable technology in basic campus and classroom infrastructure is a significant concern.
 Overall, the average rating for IT needs fulfillment was 2.78 on the scale of 5 (See Figure
1). Those who rated low noted unreliable technologies in classrooms, incompatibilities
between college-provided devices with equipment on campus, untimely or unresponsive
technological support hindered their teaching (See OA Table 1 in Appendix).
 Over 40% indicated technology in regular smart classrooms, thin client, or specialized
software do not sufficiently meet their teaching needs (See Figure 4). Furthermore, nearly
a quarter (24%) reported that they had given up using technology in regular classrooms
due to previous problems (See Figure 5).
 About two thirds of respondents (67%) experienced IT problems during the first six
weeks of Fall 2019 (See Figure 8). Of those, 39% reported the problem inhibited their
teaching in multiple class period (See Figure 9)
 When adequate IT resources are not available, the faculty 1) sacrifice components of teaching, 2)
resort to using personal resources, or 3) double their course preparation in order to prepare a
backup plan. (See OA Table 1 and 2 in Appendix)

IT Shared Governance
 A sense of ineffective shared governance is evident among the faculty. An overwhelming
majority of respondents indicated that they do not feel they have a voice in IT Governance (83%
disagree total). A large majority do not feel that IT policies at the College is developed in a fair
and transparent way (69% disagree total) or that the allocation of IT resources is fair and
transparent (71% disagree total). These sentiments are stronger among tenure-track faculty (See
Figure 12a)
 Some comments from respondents call for transparency, central involvement of faculty in IT
decision-makings, and responsiveness to faculty input (See OA Table 1 and 6 in Appendix)

II. Methodology and Sample Characteristics
This study was conducted as an anonymous online survey with the faculty of SUNY Old Westbury. An
email invitation with a link to an online questionnaire (Microsoft Form) was sent to the Old Westbury
faculty email list (faculty@oldwestbury.edu) on September 23rd, 2019. The survey closed on October
4th, 2019. The data collection and analysis were conducted by ITSGS Task Force members.
In total, 76 faculty members participated in the study. Fifty-four respondents (71%), identified
themselves as tenured or tenure-streamed faculty, while 21 (two among “other” identified themselves as
adjuncts) are on a non-tenure streamed (Table 1).

IT Needs Fulfillment
a. Overall IT Needs Fulfillment

Overall, respondents feel that the College fulfills their instructional technology needs in a limited way.
On average, respondents rated the level of IT needs fulfillment by the College as 2.78 out of 5. The
rating is lower among tenure-streamed faculty compared to non-tenure streamed faculty. Unreliable
basic infrastructure (e.g., Wi-Fi, regular smart classroom technology), ineffective and/or untimely
support, incompatibility among college-supplied equipment (e.g., a college-provided laptop and
classroom technology) are commonly noted as reasons for low rating (See OA Table 1 in Appendix).

b. IT Usage Level
The use of instructional technology is almost universal among the faculty. Only 4% of the respondents
indicated that they hardly use instructional technology. About a half of respondents are “moderate-level”
users whose IT usage is limited to slide presentations and video viewing, while over 40% indicated that
their teaching requires instructional technology beyond slide and video presentations.

In some cases, instructors give up on IT resource they found persistently unreliable or inadequate. About
a quarter of respondents (24%) indicated that they had given up using some technology in regular smart
classrooms due to previous technical problems. About one in six (17%) gave up using a classroom with
specialized technology, and one in eight (13%) discontinued the use of college-provided personal
computing devices. Those who gave up IT resources often had to forego a part of their teaching or relied
on a personally owned device (See OA Table 2 in Appendix).

IT Problems and Problem Solving
a. Channels for IT Related Communication

The faculty typically communicates their IT needs through ITS. ITS Filing a ticket (68%) and visiting
the ITS Service Desk (62%), contacting a specific person in ITS (47%) are most common ways for
respondents to communicate their IT needs with the College. One third (33%) communicate their IT
needs through the department and 9% through a faculty IT rep.

high noted helpfulness of ITS staff, but some of them still mentioned insufficient staffing as a problem
(See OA Table 4). Reasons for not reporting to ITS includes that that they could not give up the class
time for reporting, or that they did not trust ITS would fix the problem (See OA Table 5).

Q3

Too many loop holes to run through
Not enough people in IT to serve all the College's user needs in a timely manner
Bigger projects always take precedent over other small user issues
IT has limited to no support in the evening and absolutely none on the weekend. This is
appalling for a modern college to function.
IT makes policies that work for them and are absolutely exclusive of faculty user needs
Project bulbs cannot be replaced in a timely manner
DVD players or other digital media often don't work
Speakers in the classrooms have electrical static interference
software updates kick faculty off there thin client at times of the day when they are working
(6am and 6pm) when updates can be done once a day at 3am
To enter your classroom, and have to wait more than ten minutes for the computer to boot
up, and then sit, and sit while you wait for the internet to do anything...are we in the 21st
century or the 1950s? We only have ten minutes between classes, and at times that is not
enough to begin class on time. The library buys films for "streaming" but never would I trust
the ability to use such services given the breaking that happens in the streaming. I wouldn't
mind putting articles on line via Blackboard, but who copies the articles so they can by
uploaded? When technology doesn't work in the classroom, why are there no phones in
classrooms to reach out for help to IT? These are common in other schools. Students at the
help desk are typically friendly, but seem ill-equipped to actually help, and often are
interested in BSing with one another instead of helping people waiting.
I am teaching in the library and the new system is very complicated and takes a great deal of
time to organize
Even if you arrive early and load up the syatem by the time you need to use it you have to
start all over again
The smart boards are out dates and slow
Students would rather have a simple white board but no erasers so you have to use TP to
wipe the boards off, Professors leave the room dirty so whrn you teach in the late afternoon
All the days class work is still on the boards.
the computers in the classroom often do not work well (freeze or shut down while in use;
disconnect from the projector while in use, etc) and the projector system also does NOT
work well. often portions of the slides are cut off, or the projector won't even connect to the
computer without IT intervention.
I also feel that faculty should be able to obtain replacement laptops earlier than once in 5
years: my laptop is critical for both my teaching and research needs, and has gotten quite
slow and sometimes freezes/shuts down, which is highly problematic. I would also
appreciate having more memory on my institution-issued laptop.
I also think that Microsoft Outlook is a less-than desirable platform. Preferred when the
college utilized google mail.

Very tough to get assistance when you need it sometimes during a class. No instant access or
resource.
laptop/tablets distributed to fulltime faculty are not replaced in a timely and efficient
manner; if there is a technology problem (with the lap top, desktop, or classroom
technology) there isn't enough staff to address the problem in a timely and efficient manner;
technology is somewhat outdated or there aren't enough projector bulbs to support our
needs. for large events where technology , microphones, speakers, etc. are needed, there
isn't enough support for setup or for when glitches happen. There is a sense that the
campus's technology infrastructure needs updating/programs that are compatible with each
other. The email system, outlook, is so inferior to the system we had before it.
HOWEVER, the Instructional Support team (Chandra and Natasha) have been extremely
active and helpful in supporting my teaching. Chandra has especially addressed problems
I've had in a timely and efficient manner.
I teach COIL classes and do not have availability of video conferencing for my students or for
my class.
The projector in classrooms often doesn't work or doesn't work well and it is unacceptable
that there is no "hot line" and anyone available to come and fix it during class.
One of the programs (SPSS) I need for my classes and research has crashed on my laptop
about 5 times during the past year.
My computer based class was allocated a classroom with zero clients instead of regular
computers, which couldn't support our needs. There were always issues with playing video
and getting programs to run.
I placed a request to have one of the zero clients in my lab reconfigured so it doesn't delete
EVERYTHING (including the software I download) every time someone logs out. The first
request was placed in November 2018 and nothing had happened yet.
The ITS took over 6 months to figure out why a program I need for my research doesn't work
on any OW computer.
This is just a very short version of all issues I have had only during 2018-2019. The
technology related issues are the biggest frustration related to my job at this college.
I can't install the software necessary on my own computer and the software I need cannot
be installed on the lab computers for some of my classes. It seems like if IT can't "push the
install out" they simply do not install that piece of software rather than coming up with a
solution. The workaround involves having the lab assistant have admin privileges but that is
not granted to anyone outside of IT unless it is on a temporary basis. So IT 1) Won't install
the software necessary to run the class and 2) is reluctant to let anyone else install the
software necessary to run the class. And so I students end up having to bring laptops to
class. At that point why are we using the computer labs?
Lack of consistency in classroom technology, i.e., some rooms the projector and computer
work fine and in others they are not synced. Have to log in as owpod and then into faculty
account, waste of time. Takes ten minutes to get set up. Windows 10 in offices, Windows 7
in classrooms. OneDrive is very slow and saved files were not saved. Systems goes out, can't
log in in office, just too much time our fabulous tech people spend putting out fires and
trying to help us.
I have had issues in all my courses this semester. Every teaching day there are issues with
DVD players, computers, Video exchange, etc. making it difficult to begin class on time or to
show the necessary clips and images.

poor equipment performance/maintenance. Laptop assigned does not integrte with
projection system. NO instruction or resorces (could have a webinar on how to use).
Slow response time to requests, inability to get help when classroom tech doesn't work
during classes, lack of clarity on why tickets are closed, ongoing problems not addressed or
resolved, being told there are no problems when there clearly are system issues.
Tech is unreliable.
Lack of resources for refreshing out-dated equipment. Difficulty getting old equipment fixed
in a timely manner. Lack of sufficient training and online DIY support for standard tech tasks.
For example: How to videos and manuals, FAQ, available online.
Sometimes the equipment doesn't work
Having a projector with a computer is not a smart classroom. It's just a classroom with
technology in it. Smartboards in smart classrooms are not something found in our
classrooms, although they would be great to engage students more. Overall the technology
available to us is rather limited and old fashioned. Even just printing is frequently unreliable,
and when faculty have a problem with it or with classroom projectors there are usually no
staff available to help on-the-spot. Faculty calling into IT receive a response "I'll let someone
know."
or "I'll make a ticket and you'll hear back from us later" with no immediate response. Issues
are usually resolved, yes, but after a day or longer. The immediacy and importance of
prioritizing the classroom experience (except to the minimum) is not too apparent on our
campus. I understand this comes down to funding and resources, but if you want to
understand the struggles in the classroom an accurate synopsis of the current situation
would be a good place to start (don't refer to technology as "smart" when that does not
exist, this indicates a sort of cognitive dissonance and a certain level of disingenuousness).
Slow connection speeds for streaming and often network problems issues with portal, email
and Bb. No IT staff on evenings in the library
there are constant problems with the technology in the smart classrooms. This technology
does not seem to be routinely maintained by anyone on campus, and when there is an
immediate need for a solution the Help Desk is utterly useless and refuses to come help
faculty. I have been left hanging and having to change my lessons plans on countless
occasions because some aspect of the classroom technology has suddenly stopped working
and no one is available to fix it.
Displays are not compatible with my school issued laptop. ITS has not responded to the
ticket I submitted the first week of school regarding this problem.
Technology is weak at Old Westbury. The thin clients are fussy and slow to load, and
streaming from them is often difficult. It took tremendous effort to get my laptop replaced,
to gain the software I needed. Students struggle with emails not going through, and with
Blackboard being user unfriendly.
It would be nice to have a smart board in the classroom and not a white board.
This is a different skill set that would benefit from more support to make sure the student's
educational experience does not widely vary based on the mode of delivery.
IT response to tech issues is incredibly slow and interferes with the instruction of students.
Little IT support is provided to support faculty research (additional laptops, tablets etc).
Given the increasing emphasis on research productivity, faculty need to be supported in this
way.
it is difficult to get a quick response

Classroom tech is sometimes not working, requiring IT person to come up to class, which
may or may not happen in a timely manner; my laptop is old and cannot yet be replaced, I
am told.
Computers in classrooms often don't work.
Projectors are outdated or misaligned in NSB. Whiteboards needed. Computers are slow or
need updating. HDMI connection needed. Wifi is unreliable. No working projector in S102.
Simple tasks such as getting projectors to work and getting slides to display are often quite
difficult.
Even at a basic level -- The ability to stream material off the web is hit-or-miss, and can be
very slow. DVD players in the classrooms should be upgraded to blu-ray players (which can
ALSO play DVDs). They are not always 'synced' with the inputs in the classroom.
I'm also going to throw in a comment about e-mail, here. The gmail service that we had was
terrific. I understand that we received a 'package' of some sort for taking on Microsoft
Outlook, but it's truly not the greatest e-mail, and whatever we 'received' in exchange for
the swap is, I am willing to bet, now outdated anyway...Plus, the e-mail seems to 'come and
go,' with very little explanation offered when it goes down.
A laptop is provided, but the support is limited (any repairs/ updates take the laptop away
for a significant amount of time, leading me not to get repairs since I cannot work without
it). In the classroom, the projector is unreliable (whether it works, whether portion is cut
off), and the video/ sound is unreliable. Help requests are not always taken care of during
the semester, so I have had to rely on alternate plans instead of using technology in
instruction.
We have many great resources, but are unable to utilize them adequately because they are
unreliable/not updated/not compatible with each other or that we are not informed how to
utilize them. Technologies in smart classrooms and library classrooms would be great if they
are reliably functional. I believe the College has software licenses the faculty can utilize, but
we do not even know what are available to us without a functional list (the current software
list on the ITS website is not functional).
On the one hand, I rarely feel that technological aids are useful in my teaching. On the other,
I rarely feel it would be easy to reliably implement them if I did feel they were useful. It's a
big ole "meh."
I teach in the NAB and the Library. The NAB computers and projectors routinely work fine,
but the library technology was - for the first month - not compatible with my school-issued
tablet. I have to check out an iPad before each of my classes. Suddenly, two weeks ago, none
of the iPads had the requisite technology (Vision Exchange) to work with the class
Smartboard - there had been a problem and no one had checked on them or noticed - the
only solution was to go borrow an iPad from Chandra. As far as I know, the issue hasn't yet
been resolved.
Technology is present, but not always functional. Lag time between my computer and
screen make it difficult to use effectively.
Labs are available when I need them, but SPSS doesn’t always work properly.
More importantly, the new smart boards in the library have lots of glitches and don’t work
with all computers. When that is overcome, the internet is slow, so streaming videos is
nearly impossible.
Multiple classrooms have issues with the projectors, that even though reported, do not get
solved. Classes are disrupted.

I am not always able to maintain internet service in the basement of the library. This inhibits
my use of vision exchange.
Connections to projectors are often malfunctioning.
Projectors do not work well with current screen resolutions.
Podium computers do not have the ability to present in presentation mode.
Installation of software and configuration options in laptops has been limited severely.
Access to software in computer labs is limited.
Some college utilities such as blackboard do not function for image based student
assignments. Projectors are quite low quality in some labs.
All my needs were eventually met, but communication was often slow. My computer and
connections have worked well so far. However, I have found that Blackboard is not user
friendly.
many times the tech isn't working fully or internet access gets interrupted.
This more has to do with the upgrades and maintenance which I believe need improvement.
When asked to have specific software installed it has not been done after two years of
asking. Also no feed back on where it stands. It's not a money issue because it free. Was also
approved by the chair
There are frequent problems with the functioning of classroom computers and audio/visual
components.
At times, the internet connection has failed.
Most of the time I'm able to achieve what I need in the classroom, but when things go wrong
it seems like they go pretty wrong. Even direct simple things like projectors not functioning
properly or not having the necessary software can really disrupt a class
Equipment need regular maintenance.
We need SPSS software, which is installed in the NAB labs, but not other computers.
Students complain about that. It would be nice if they can have remote access to campus
computers with SPSS to do homework.
When the thin client in our seminar room AND the DVD player stopped functioning, we were
unable to get these repaired for months. In fact I still don't know if these have been
repaired. Others in my department have had to try to change classrooms in order to have
one with functioning technology.
With regard to laptops and servicing of them and/or help with them, I have had no difficulty
and have felt the IT people were helpful. We have also frequently called on IT to fix minor
problems in classrooms and have been happy with their response and work.
The technology in my classroom is sufficient, although there is a large tv screen on the side
of the room which I don't use and which blocks the chalkboard. But, what is really lacking is
IT in the teaching labs. In particular, there are no projectors and there is no way to interface
the lab equipment with student computers.
Need computer setup for science teaching labs.
My needs aren't great, but sometimes the audio is not working well, or the image (slide) is
not fully projected onto the screen. On occasion, I have had to move my class to another
classroom in order for them to do their presentations because the equipment is not
working/working well.
Classroom equipment is cumbersome sometimes and, on occasion, has not worked.
As an adjunct I was placed in a library classroom with Vision Exchange. I didn’t expect to
have to bring my own laptop and had to come on campus extra time to meet with someone
and learn how to use some of the basic features.

interrupted service. recurring faulty devices that continuously malfunction. Though, the IT
response time is usually quick which is good.
Unreliability of technology due to either hardware issues or limited WiFi. Limited interaction
with IT about what my needs actually are or what my vision for ideal classroom technology
might be. Absence of clear policies - or lack of communication about or adherence to those
policies - for getting issues resolved. Students issues with on campus technology also impact
my ability to teach in the way I might like.
Some of the podia (podiums?) are not treated well and so I frequently encounter issues with
the equipment
Some of the software is not up to date and not having permissions to the lab computers
makes it difficult to make updates and install drivers for peripheral equipment.
Help is available to those who ask for it, but it is frustrating I have to walk around with
several dongles. Also, some of the equipment is not super intuitive--the learning curve can
be steep
Like anything else, it is not perfect. Can be annoying to reboot system if prior user does not
log off properly
Classroom I use have had little trouble and personnel accommodating
I am currently teaching a hybrid course, and I would have appreciated having the in-class
lecture component be in a classroom with smart technology to match the level of technology
that is expected for at least half the course. For example, the current room in NSB I am in has
an old projector and screen and a regular chalk blackboard. So I can barely bring up the
online stuff to show clearly in class because of the low-quality view of the screen.
the IT staff has been responsive to my questions and needs, however, the classrooms often
have issues, which is why I gave 4 starts and not 5. For example, projectors routinely cut off
side margins or the bottom margins of slides, which is really frustrating.
I did not experience a real problem in the class I was teaching at the library. The laptop cart
that I use for the class is OK, but the laptops are coming to the end of their lifecycle. We are
using a 2018 version of the video editing software, and 2019 version is already out. Some
students use Adobe creative cloud from their personal computers which offers 2019 version.
2019 and 2018 versions are not compatible.
There are occasional problems with DVD players.
I'm happy that we have smart classrooms. Only problem I've had is that sometimes it
malfunctions, and the help desk staff comes up with excuses instead of fixing the problem.
Provisions are available for my needs. I am also provided with support if needed.
The technology supports outside commercial program I use plus the use of Blackboard as an
alternate support system.
X!
Great IT support.
I rarely have trouble with the technology, and if I do, it is addressed quickly.
At the beginning of every semester, I make sure to reserve a room at the IT, so that my
students can attend for lab every three weeks. I have always been given the classroom I
request with no problems.
I do not have very specialized needs.
The technology meets my needs.

Re: thin clients. Thin clients take a very long time to log in. There have been times
when I neglected to log in ahead of time, and waiting for the startup procedure to
complete was not worth the time.
re: smart classrooms. Projectors rarely malfunction, but it happens. I will not rely on
using them unless I have actually checked *that day* that they function. Hey, things
break sometimes, and I began the comment by saying malfunctions were rare. But
there have been classrooms in which malfunctioning projectors were not fixed for
several weeks.
re: other hardware. I was asked on my hire what sort of printer I wanted. I said "I
don't care as long as it's laser, not inkjet," and was told "ok, that's fine, come get it
next week." The next week I came to pick up my... inkjet printer. I simply bought my
own laserjet printer and have happily used it since. Since that happened about a
month after I started at OW, and also was during the long period of "our college has a
nonfunctional website," it informed my expectations of IT and other functional
aspects of the school.
in effective IT support. If IT is only on campus part time how can any user get full
time service. The college needs IT support 24/7, not Monday to Thursday 9am to
4pm.

I have chosen not to use Blackboard given the minimal support that seems available.

As much as I would like to give up on several of the above that is not an option given
the tech-driven nature of my responsibilities.

I have stopped using the school iPads and tried to use my own tablet for the library
smart classroom, which doesn't function well if I need to show videos. So, I have
adapted by eliminated videos that I had previously used to illustrate certain concepts.
It is frustrating.
there are too many restrictions on software updates for Mac users that require
administrative authorization, it's simply ridiculous.

Wait for college laptop too long

There is a projector in NAB 2129 which I stopped using because it stutters up and
down unless you shut it off repeatedly (like 3-4 times). I also have somewhat given
up with trying to accommodate students trying to use Blackboard on the phone app
because the interface is so bad the students constantly say they "can't find anything"
-- I now just tell them to use a computer (unfortunately many don't, and it causes
massive continued confusion). All i can do is continue to repeat myself to students
that they should use a computer.
I teach using a lot of different types of technology including regularly blended/hybrid
and online courses and so I have no choice but to struggle with the existing
technological problems on campus.
I stopped using DVDs in class altogether. I only show videos for which I can save a
video file on my computer. I use my own laptop to teach most of the time, as I cannot
connect it properly in any of my classrooms if I want to use the college's video
streaming service (which I use constantly). I asked for a room change but did not get
one, so I screen videos in another classroom when prof. who was issued the room
does not need it or after the class regularly scheduled there is over. Microsoft Office
365 / OneDrive is very problematic. Links to shared documents expire, causing all
sorts of problems. My colleagues and I use Google Docs / Google Slides / Google
Sheets instead.
Internet so slow I can’t show documentaries. Glitches make static noise and other
issues on smart boards.

Very complicated and the wifi is inconsistent in the library.
I can not depend on the system working so I have left out technology in my courses
I have actually had the students use their own phones to watch a Utube interview
because the technology was not working.
Either not applicable or access was not made available

In a couple classrooms the projector does not work well. I have had to gather
students in the front of the classroom and use my laptop. About 365, I currently only
use the email and calendar. Google has more user friendly tools.
I am able to connect my laptop with a cable and my needs are met

Can't use podium thin client for presentation mode. Use laptop despite multiple

Thin client in office vastly inferior to laptop. I use the laptop in the office.
Not able to configure or install software/updates due to admin account taken away in

I find office 365 to be unreliable/ too often unavailable off campus and even in some
labs. Blackboard is useful only for text based or written materials, therefore pointless
to use if those are not primary uses.
I simply need to utilize the tools I am already using. I cannot simply stop using them.
As they are, they are less than optimal, and time is often wasted in trying to
maneuver them into working properly.
While I had problems with many of the items listed in 6, I need them for my work and
teaching and so cannot give up using them altogether. the problems have, however,

Neither computer lab or the classrooms with specialized technology have cameras
and microphone which makes it unsuitable for video conferencing. Another issue is
the software needed to proctor online exams.
These are tools I have adapted to and that students expect, so I cannot suspend their
use, regardless of whether it is ideal or not.

Trying to integrate Panopto into the classroom has been difficult. SPSS provided by IT
barely functions. Our version of Blackboard is dated and limited.

it is difficult to get needed software for department use. It is almost 2 years since I
requested adobe suite for my faculty. it is needed for their positions. Right now they
use free resources and have piece together documents which is time consuming

The technologies and equipment are essential; I cope with the challenges reluctantly.

Asked for help from colleagues and individuals in IT, but it often disrupted class time.

Due to SPSS crashing on my laptop, I stop relying on it. I use my personal computer
whenever possible which means that on many days I carry 2 laptops with me.

I stopped using the classroom desktops. Had to change rooms due to the audio-visual
and laptop-projector connection not working.
There was just no way to accomplish what I needed otherwise.

In the library smart board, it is very inconvenient to connect my laptop to it.

I moved out of our seminar room and into another classroom when technology
consistently did not work. In our department we have had to move faculty to other
classrooms because of technology malfunctions.
I purchased a suite of Microsoft Office so as not to have to use the online versions.
Very time consuming and frustrating to plan slides and links to then not be able to
have the thin client read flash drive or properly save to OneDrive. I have two
OneDrive accounts and am continually prompted to set up yet another. Think client
is slow or suddenly logs me off. Can't count on getting any work accomplished in
office.

Classroom technology is unreliable, and has quit numerous times when I had online
activities/ videos/ PPT slides for a class session. In some classes, I have completely
abandoned using technology for this reason. In others, I minimize it and create
alternate plans. The thin clients do not work in all rooms, so I rely on my laptop. I do
not update/repair the laptop due to required time away from it. I have lost important
files through MS Office 365 and IT was unable to provide any support or backup of
the files. I do not use it as a consequence.

I came on campus extra time. Set an appt with someone to teach me Vision
exchange. I’m an adjunct and this was not simple.

Use my own laptop - omitted items that could be reviewed in class

I am using a way overdue laptop because I am afraid to have a laptop that I am
unable to perform necessary updates or installation.

Whenever I use any tech or Internet in my classes, I need to plan a backup lesson, in
case the tech doesn't work. This doubles my work load. I teach media, so I must use
tech. If I taught a different subject, I would have returned to paper and pencils to
avoid all of this extra work and stress. I also must use Bb, as I teach hybrid courses,
but if I had any choice I would use a different LMS. Students constantly complain
about BB and have tech issues. There are so many "known issues" that Bb is not
addressing and the interface is very outdated. Students hate it and have many
problems with it. The biggest issue I face is that BB has a mobile app that does not
work and that we are told to tell students not to use, yet many of my students only
have access to phones or tablets at home, no computers. They are constantly missing
portions of my course due to this broken Bb app.

Stopped using video clips in classes because at different points either the WiFi didn’t
work, the projector didn’t work (for any of a variety of reasons), or the DVD player
didn’t work. The thin client doesn’t have any speakers so I couldn’t use that to
preview clips- and couldn’t get speakers from IT. 365 tools are often insufficient for
my needs and/or are unreliable. My laptop doesn’t even update properly and it needs
to be brought to IT and left for multiple days to have updates installed (every time
there’s an update), I can’t install software on it, and when it broke, no one could give
me a clear answer for getting it repaired or replaced for months.

Too many to explain.
Failure of computer to start
Failure of phones to work
Ten minute delay in getting computer going in classroom. (30 seconds feels like an hour when you have 30
students waiting to begin something, or waiting to be distracted.)
I teach courses at the radio station and the PC's that are the infrastructure of the station were manufactured in
2011. A 3-5 year refresh cycle would be optimal. No amount of tech support can keep these failing PC's
operational. This is seriously impacting my ability to teach and for student media production as well. Student
and faculty morale is very poor. Students are once more making jokes about nothing working at Old Westbury.
My other classes in the NAB are fine. The smart classrooms that I have been assigned are operational. No
issues.
See question 3
The above mentioned restrictions on allowing updates and running some software on Mac laptops; there
should not be any restrictions on faculty being able to update software and other programs on their Mac
laptops.
NAB 2121 projector control malfunction

The graphics software is not up to date and because there are so few IT people it takes a long time to get
software issues fixed.
L322 - lag between my laptop and screen make it difficult to present PowerPoints and videos
Volume is not wireless and adapter for school issued MacBook is not issued.
Smart board white board feature also has a lag, so difficult to use.
the computer would not sync to the projector in my classroom (NAB-2nd floor)
My school issued computer is not compatible with smart boards: as per my above comments I cannot connect
via HDMI, and thus cannot stream video, as streaming off a remote connection works poorly. Audio quality in
my classroom (where I teach a film class) is extremely poor and overall the tech in the room is not suited to my
needs. I wish someone would consult with professors before issuing classrooms.

The systems do not work consitently in the library
Projector in classrooms. New restrictions with mac laptops imposed by the college; I cannot even use my own

Q13 - Regarding Q12, please explain why you feel that way. (Q12 IT service rating - 5
stars)
Told that my issues are common issues with this technology and thats just the way
they are.
I gave a detailed description of the problem, including mentioning that the problem
doesn't begin until 10 minutes or so. Edward then agrees to meet me to start of my
next class (which was next week - he had a whole week to fix the problem but did
nothing), tells me he has given up getting apple adapters to works (I tell him they have
been working for me since the building opened in 2012), we check that things work - I
tell him no duh, the issue is is it going to continue to work, he leaves, and then to no
surprise it stops working 10 minutes or so into class. (I later informed him, and he
then went an reset the system. That may have fixed it. But he could have done that in
the several days from when i sent the report to when he met me in class.)
It feels like tickets are closed without addressing the underlying issues.
student workers had no idea, and other staff were busy and said fill out the IT form
when my computer would not start.
IT is fine. They are just not responsive quickly. They work on their own timeline.
Luckily I don't rely so heavily on technology that it stops any class (well, I design my
class to avoid this problem, since I know IT may not send a rep. when there is a
problem).
The tech assistant in the library is very helpful. ITS did not respond to my ticket. I have
not filed another ticket or followed up because I am focused on fulfilling my own job
responsibilities. I came up with my own workarounds to address tech issues.
The person didn't know how to fix the issue - I actually figure it out later by myself.
It took over a week to have each issue resolved.
Ignored me the first time; second time someone came, worked on it briefly, said it was
working, but then the same problem re-occurred after they left; finally, got an email
saying everything in the classroom worked, when it obviously did not.
No support for an evening class. ITS staff responded, but the ticket was closed without
solving the problem. I feel individual ITS staff are trying hard, but their hands are tied;
they do not make purchasing decisions, they do not decide replacement cycles, and
they are severely understaffed. I can imagine how frustrating it must be to be in their
position.
Too many delays to respond and scheduling conflicts.
For the top floor of the student union (OWWR, The Catalyst) the main issue is not tech
support. It is the lack of funding and planning for inevitable and predictable refreshing
of old tech. Tech support is over-worked and under-staffed. It is often difficult to get
tech issues attended to quickly but that is because of the demand for support and the
lack of sufficient staffing to handle rush for support at critical points in the academic
calendar.
The lack of IT staff delays having issues addressed.
The support is there but you can not run around the library half way through class
looking for support. So I just gave up
I have reported problems with the projectors multiple times, and they not always get
solved.

Still waiting, but they are busy with other issues that I agree are more important to the
running of the school.
the situation in my classroom was (for the most part) remedied. however, as many of
the problems are such that I have experienced more than once over the course of my
time at OW, I am concerned that they will arise again.
my laptop concerns me as I believe the issues are related to its age: it is 4 years old and
has experienced heavy, constant use, as my primary tool for teaching and professional
research and writing.
They did resolve the issues eventually, by moving me to another computer lab. And
from now on, my class if moving to a different room on a weekly basis, which is far
from an ideal solution.
I put in a work request but still had issues and am now using other methods
Error in selecting!

these problems would have been avoidable with planning.

Q14 (If Q11= No) Why did you decide not to request help from the ITS?
have not had time yet
Honestly, in the moment, I just moved on and adjusted the teaching. I also teach in the evening, and
so once I am done, I typically just go home and don't think about it.
I did not bother requesting help from ITS because any time I have ever called IT for help they have
told me that they cannot help immediately and to put in a ticket which is generally completely
ignored. A few times, I have had to literally beg and plead with them to come fix problems and they
begrudgingly have. These have always been simple fixes that have taken no more than a few minutes
of their time. I think faculty deserve much more support and respect from ITS. They are often rude,
impossible to get in touch with, and simply not helpful.
I didn't think they would be able to help. It seems like a more systemic underinvestment in
technology.
I have placed IT requests for classrooms every semester and no support has been provided, so I have
stopped requesting support.
I was able to go around the problem.
It takes up too much valuable teaching time to stop and call ITS
It was in the evening and I was not sure anyone would be available in time.
It was not ncessary- I was able to find workarounds to use Blackboard, the program was just clunky

I may have lied in some of the earlier questions, but anything that could potentially be used to identify the
respondent should really have a "prefer not to answer" option.
Q7 indicates that I quickly deduced that technological needs beyond "the outlets function" were best served
by personal initiative, and not relying on the college (although I do recall hearing stories about computer labs
relying on a questionable web of extension cords shortly after the NAB was completed, so even outlets might
not be a reliable given). The network works, though, and that's no small feat. I appreciate that we actually get
internet, and over 90% of the time, at that. So there's not enough for me to actually *complain* about
anything, but since you ask...
Minor things indicate a questionable IT status at the college. For example, if I load the connect.oldwestbury
webpage, I can be greeted with a functional-looking portal, including a notification of how many unread
emails I have. If I then click on the "Office365" link to actually read those messages, I can immediately be
prompted to log in. Which is it? Either my stored credentials were recognized enough to check the server to
see how many unread emails I have, or my login had expired and I need to re-enter my ID and password. It
can't be both. Or maybe it can. I'm no physicist.
If I use a hard-wired ethernet connection to a desktop/laptop, I can automatically connect (unsecured) to
something called "Network6" which provides no internet access; attempting to load any page brings up a
warning that the connection is unsecured (probably because the credentials aren't recognized by whatever
external DNS server is being queried?). A refresh of my login credentials then connects to oldwestbury.edu
and provides internet access. What is Network6, and how deep in some 1990's setup of an ancient server
does it live?
The ever-recurring "reply-all" chains make me wonder if "faculty@oldwestbury.edu" is a restricted
distribution list, or if I can start using it to sign up for website accounts like catfacts. I haven't actually tested
this theory yet, but I suspect that anyone can email that account, even from an external address that isn't
officially tied to an OW registered account. So... if we start getting college-wide catfacts emails, you know
who to suspect. Protecting a distribution list from external access is super-basic stuff, though, so maybe I'm
wrong on that one. But some of those reply-all chains definitely involve non-OW addresses.
I get that IT infrastructure is a disgusting mess that survives as much under its own mystical gravity as it does
under any actual human intent, but every once in a while these sorts of things make me wonder if OW falls
more under "monster" than it does "Frankenstein."
Get more staff to work evenings and the weekends

You need more people available for help. Training of students should include respect toward faculty, and I am
not a person who demands much respect due to my position. (generally students are very good--but there
have been times when they're too busy hanging to give you their attention.) You need an emergency person
that folks can reach out to...I had one, who is gone. At this point I don't know about support for major events,
but in the past it was pretty goddawful. This makes the College look incompetent.
Bigger budget, better planning, more transparency. Bigger role for faculty in tech governance. Adoption of
best practices from other SUNY ITS. More online resources such as DIY training videos and FAQ info for
getting tech help and understanding tech resources available. What we have is misunderstood and underutilized.
More IT workers to help with issues. The one time I set up a ticket item online, it took IT 2 weeks to get back
to me.
remove restrictions on faculty using their mac laptops!
Hire more staff so that faculty problems can be prioritized and responded to in-the-moment. Invest in actual
smart classrooms and survey faculty about specific technologies to improve the campus. Rather than pushing
large changes onto the campus "from IT", think about posing questions to departments to obtain
departmental consensus about important issues and use this as a basis for decision-making.
Here's another incident worth sharing: I put in a request to book computer labs for my Fall 2019 classes in
July. The request was assigned to someone who apparently no longer works at the college. The request was
never reassigned. I sent repeated email to the Help Desk asking someone to book the rooms for me. I have

automated message telling me to hold and then get disconnected). my secretary told me to contact Edward
Brunet, who is apparently some kind of manager down there. I called him and he has no idea whose job it is
to assign computer labs or how to even do it. He suggested I come down to the Help Desk and speak to Glen
the next time I am on campus. Okay, fine, but can we address the bigger issues here? WHY IS THE PHONE LINE
BROKEN AND NO ONE RESPONDS TO EMAIL???? This situation is beyond frustrating. Or, how about at the end
of last semester when I suddenly couldn't print from my office? It took until the week before the Fall semester
started (that's 3+ months during what I imagine is the slowest time of the year) for someone to come fix it,
and they only came because my dept. secretary and I finally went down to ITS and demanded that someone
look at it that day.
Consult with faculty about classroom needs and about the technology that is purchased so we can give
feedback on how tech will be incorporated into our teaching and our curriculum.
Using the same systems fromone building to the next
Very confusing
Some faculty have Dell some Macs I was told by It that my Mac would have problems with the new system I
asked for another computer so that I could teach using technology and was told that they do not have any
computers that could be loaned to faculty this is a gap!
None come to mind.
Would be great to switch to Canvas (not Blackboard)
Distribute laptops before classes begin
Communicate tech policies
Thank you to the creators of this survey!
IT should consult with faculty about what our needs and concerns are - especially when they decide to
purchase new equipment or software.
Regular refreshes to equipment and programs needed to teach technical media and communications courses.
Their ft staff is limited
I think we should be able to add a printer to the laptops. It's really inconvenient that I can't print from the
Macbook Air.
From what I experience IT governance needs to be more receptive to faculty input.
I prefer not to answer as I already concerned about the anonymity of my previous answers.

OA Table 6. Comments
It would be good to hear when IT has new technology available that might be relevant to offbeat use cases or
creative endeavors
Not sure
The reservation of computer labs should be made easier. It is not difficult to have a website that faculty can
just book the dates and time slots, instead of emailing to the IT service people, which is inefficient and
inconvenient.
Technology always breaks -- IT needs to accept that as a fact of life and not be defensive about the fact that
things don't always work. The key is how IT responds to difficulties and reports of problems and to what
degree it sees its responsibility has keeping classroom technology functioning. We don't need 'cutting edge'
technology -- we need proven technology that may be a bit out dated but is know to work and how to fix it
when it doesn't is also known.
The thin clients should be torn out, smashed apart with hammers, and the crumbled remains tossed into the
fiery depths of hell.
Lacking that, IT should provide us with email/courseware/software that actually runs on the thin clients.
Outlook 365 is the worse offender here. My worklife would be much improved if I had functioning email while
I am on campus. Instead, I have Outlook. Everyday, it lags, it hangs, it crashes while I search for old emails, it
sometimes does not copy the text of the previous email when I reply to someone, and there have even been
times when it spontaneously leaves out the content of an email.
It is unacceptable to not have classroom equipment prepared for the start of the semester and continually
tested weekly.
Other issues that are not related to instructional support: I stopped using SPSS (necessary for analyzing some
of my former data) because IT was unable to provide an updated license to me without bringing the computer
to them. I was working on data analysis over summer break and was away for several months. Because of this,
I was unable to analyze my data, and by the time I regained access to the software the data was no longer
relevant (due to publication deadlines and political changes that impacted the generalizability/usefulness of
the study). The inability to provide support for my software needs without physically taking the computer, I
was unable to publish my data.
I understand that we suffer the lack of resources like many other campuses. My main frustration is that we
are unable to make use of resources we have, and that is the system problem rather than the resource
problem. For instance, why does the college purchase classroom equipment that are not compatible with
Macs when it supply Macs to its faculty (and even encourage us to choose Macs over Windows machines)?
Why do they take away the capacity to take care of our own laptop when ITS is incapable of supplying
sufficient services for us? Security is important, of course, but how much does it enhance security and how
much damage does it cause to our productivity? If security is the real reason to prohibit admin rights to the
faculty, then the College should prohibit the faculty from using personally-owned devices for work (which is
much less secure) and ensure all faculty members who handle student information have an updated
computing device with timely service. If it is not possible, they should think of an alternative. My point - if we
do not have resources, we should think about the way to use resources we have in the most effective way;
minimize dead resources due to incompatibility, prioritize the basic infrastructure (Wifi and smart classrooms
should be functional reliably) and help faculty to be as self sufficient as possible. I don't think the current
system is going to that direction.
Worth noting in Q4, thin client is really only important because it provides an alternative when my primary
laptop doesn’t work for some reason, or because the classroom hdmi (for example) isn’t working. It’s
necessary to have a backup plan at all times - the thin client is one.
Re q10, see above about always having a backup plan.

Part Three
SUNY Case Study

I.

SUNY Case Study: Methodology

During September and October 2019, ITGS TF members reached out to the University Faculty Senate and
the other SUNY Comprehensive Colleges. In total, we reached out to 14 individuals directly (and those
individuals often reached out to others – e.g. CIOs, liaisons to other bodies, faculty who had previously
served in these roles – on our behalf). We received substantive feedback from five individuals,
representing four different campuses. All but one are faculty members and everyone is/was involved in IT
governance in some leadership capacity. In addition, task force members reviewed information publicly
available via College and Faculty Senate websites of 12 SUNY Comprehensive Colleges (all except OW)
and searched for best practices promoted by relevant non-profit and professional organizations.

II.

SUNY IT Shared Governance Models

There are a variety of structures for faculty involvement in technology-related planning and decisionmaking across SUNY. While we asked people to comment on the effectiveness of the structure used at
their institution, none of our five respondents responded directly to this question. Thus, we present the
information we collected simply as possible alternatives to the Old Westbury model.
1. Centralized IT Standing Committee (e.g., Oneonta, New Paltz)
At several colleges, faculty involvement on educational technology matters is organized through a
standing committee of the Faculty Senate, often called something like Educational or Academic
Technology Committee (“ETC”). According to Faculty Senate Bylaws and one subject from a campus
that uses this structure, such committees are often the “primary avenue for faculty recommendations about
policies, procedures, and planning related to the use of technology for teaching and learning,” which is
understood broadly. At SUNY Oneonta, for example, this committee makes recommendations for the
purchase and support of computer hardware, software, and other educational technology (e.g. faculty
computers, LMS). The Bylaws for SUNY New Paltz states that the ETC “develops educational
technology priorities” and engages in “strategic planning of the use of educational technology.” The
charge of this ETC includes sponsoring public forums to discuss such issues, and “evaluat(ing)
educational technology initiatives and outcomes to insure efficient implementation, coordination, and
support of high priority projects.”
2. Tiered IT Shared Governance (e.g., Downstate)
A respondent from one campus described a structure in which each school has what is known as a “Tech
Fee” committee, comprised of a mix of appointed faculty and administrators, that manages the schoolspecific budget constituted of student technology fees. Chaired by a faculty member, the committee for
each school at this campus reviews and approves proposals for technology purchases geared toward
teaching/learning (a restriction on how student tech fees are spent). An additional campus-wide steering
committee brings together representatives from each of the school-specific committees to foster
communication and collaboration.
3. Issue-Based Shared Governance (e.g., Cortland, Brockport)
A representative of another campus described a decentralized structure that involves stakeholders through
involvement in multiple issue-based committees. For example, a Banner Steering Committee “reviews
plans, recommends dates for upgrades, and actively participates in testing” and includes representatives
from every major office on campus. A College Technology Committee at this same campus solely
reviews and approves IT budgets. While this structure did seem to allow for meaningful participation, the
respondent expects that the campus will move toward consolidating some committees/functions.
ITSGS Report: SUNY Case Study - C 1

While we have limited information, subjects typically described campus IT committees that were
primarily comprised of faculty, with representation from ITS (e.g. CIO, relevant ITS staff member(s), or
both). Likely because these committees are often standing committees of the faculty senate, the chairs of
these committees were typically faculty members, and included voting and non-voting members meeting
regularly (typically monthly, sometimes twice per month), scheduled via Doodle Polls.
Of course, in many cases websites did not indicate the existence of a technology-related advisory
committee, and two respondents reported limited or inconsistent involvement of faculty. For example, at
SUNY Cortland, a standing committee on Course Teacher Evaluations was involved in the selection of a
new platform for online course evaluations, but Faculty Senate had been excluded from other decisions
(“...there have been other technological changes that are never even brought through senate at all”), an
apparent source of frustration.
In each of the cases where we were able to identify clear mechanisms for faculty input, we observed
structures that included multiple faculty, with clear connections to the Faculty Senate, who reported
substantive and collaborative involvement in various stages of planning, purchasing, and policy making.

III.

Elements of Best Practice

Task Force members also reviewed websites of professional organizations in search of best practice
examples and models. In one of these websites, Educause offers pragmatic suggestions for IT governance
best practice.
Educause is a global non-profit “higher education technology association and the largest community of IT
leaders and professionals.” Its members “include U.S. and international higher education institutions,
corporations, not-for-profit organizations, and K–12 institutions.” All 13 SUNY comprehensive colleges,
including SUNY Old Westbury, are members. The Educause website provides guidance, resources, and
examples of other small liberal arts colleges that have strengthened (or developed) IT governance
structures.
Their “Higher Education IT Governance Checklist”1 provides a succinct overview of effective IT
governance characteristics. This document identifies four central values in IT Governance, pointing to the
central importance of communication with stakeholders, obtaining buy-in, and reflecting their needs in IT
policy decision making:





Aligning IT decisions with institutional mission and stakeholder needs;
Improving communication among the IT community and between IT and the rest of the institution;
Ensuring stakeholder buy-in into policy decisions and IT budget and project priorities;
Integrating risk management into IT decision making
(Educause 2017 “Higher Education IT Governance Checklist,” page 3)

Educause suggests that successful governance in IT decision-making is predicated on active committees
with clear guiding principles, collaborative and transparent stakeholder involvement, leadership support,
and a division of responsibilities among committees that have clear roles, responsibilities, and decisionmaking rules – with a distinction between advisory groups and decision-making bodies.

ITSGS Report: SUNY Case Study - C 2

The Educause checklist also indicates that active management and regular review of governance
processes are essential for successful IT governance. It argues that clear documentation of decisionmaking process (in the form of agenda and minutes) and effective, transparent communication with
stakeholders are critical. The document suggests, at minimum, the following items need be communicated
with stakeholders in order to create the ground for effective IT governance:


How IT governance works: Stakeholders across the campus community must understand what
kinds of issues governance addresses, how to bring issues to governance, how governance
addresses them, and who their governance representatives are. This cannot be a one-time
communication but must be an ongoing effort designed to reach important groups such as campus
leadership in IT, academic, and business units (from C-level executives through line managers),
IT staff, and governance participants.



Agendas and minutes: Not only do governance participants need to know what issues they will be
considering but the campus community at large should be able to find out what is coming before
governance. A standard format and timetable for publishing agendas and minutes will facilitate
communication. Agendas need to be accessible in advance and should be published publicly.



Decisions and recommendations: It must be a straightforward process for the campus community
to learn the outcomes of governance decision making. Generating buy-in may also require
including some level of explanation of the rationale. The communication plan should take into
account how quickly decisions should be communicated.
