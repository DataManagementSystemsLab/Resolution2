Concerns with the current class schedule:








because of faculty schedules (i.e., prohibition on
three courses in a row), the current schedule
creates scheduling congestion around common
hour (the 10:20-, 1:00- and 2:50- meeting periods)
dept. demand creates a classroom shortage during
the middle of the day
common hour in the middles of the day (noon1:00) makes an hour of “prime time” unavailable
for class meetings
60-minute common hour is “too short” for many
activities, meetings, etc.
since this schedule was developed, student- faculty
interactions have migrated so that there are viable
supplements and alternatives to in-class meeting
there is inefficient use of the full day (only seven
class meeting periods)
