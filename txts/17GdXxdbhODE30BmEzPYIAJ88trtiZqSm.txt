Proposal for Automatic Linkage between Pre- and Post-Requisite Course Registration

Submitted by the Academic Practices Committee, 3/24/16

Whereas, many courses throughout the College’s programs have pre-requisites, and

Whereas, there currently exists a loophole whereby students can remain registered for post-requisite courses even after failing to pass the relevant pre-requisite (due to their ability to register for post-reqs while still taking pre-reqs the previous semester), and

Whereas, this situation puts students who have failed pre-requisite courses at an academic disadvantage in relevant post-requisite courses and undermines the verticality of program curricula, and 

Whereas, correcting for this loophole on a case-by-case basis by post-requisite course instructors and the Registrar creates unnecessary and additional labor for both parties that could be reduced by the feasible introduction of appropriate programming into the registration system,

Be It Resolved that the Office of the Registrar begin the process of implementing such programming as will automatically de-register students for post-requisite courses if and when they fail to pass the relevant pre-requisites, and

Be It Further Resolved that notification to affected students of such de-registration will occur as soon as possible after their failure to pass relevant pre-reqs, and

Be It Further Resolved that such automatic deregistration would not supersede instructors’ discretion to allow individual students to enroll in post-reqs despite incompletion of pre-reqs, based on consultation with the student and their judgment.
