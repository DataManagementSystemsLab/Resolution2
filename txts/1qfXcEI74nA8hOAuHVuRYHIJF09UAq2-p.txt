Resolution in Support of the Black Lives Matter Movement
WHEREAS acts of racial violence, anti-Blackness, and institutional racism have a long history and are
deeply embedded in our society; and
WHEREAS people of color, and Black people in particular, continue to be disproportionately harassed,
abused, and murdered by police in the contemporary United States; and
WHEREAS the murder of George Floyd is just one example of a Black man killed at the hands of police;
and
WHEREAS the recent killings of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Sean Reed, and Tony McDade are
among countless tragic illustrations of the terrorization of Black and Brown people in the name of policing;
and
WHEREAS this reality has been overlooked, ignored, and denied for generations; and
WHEREAS Black lives matter; and
WHEREAS nationwide protests have emerged to fight for racial justice and end police violence; and
WHEREAS these protests are occurring in the midst of a pandemic that is disproportionately killing
people of color; and
WHEREAS we recognize the toxic impact of systemic racism on our students, alumni, staff, faculty, their
families and communities; and
WHEREAS social justice is central to the mission of SUNY Old Westbury; and
WHEREAS institutions of higher education should be leaders in the practice of equity, community
building, and civic engagement; and
WHEREAS the absence of an expression of solidarity with those protesting racial oppression
communicates complicity with racial oppression;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that SUNY Old Westbury faculty and staff offer our unwavering
commitment of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement; students, alumni, staff, and faculty of
color; and continued efforts toward the erasure of racial inequity and oppression.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that SUNY Old Westbury administration issue an immediate statement of
our College’s unwavering commitment of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement; students, staff,
and faculty of color; and continued efforts toward the erasure of racial inequity and oppression.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that SUNY Old Westbury dedicate the 2020-2021 Academic Year to the
curricular and co-curricular (e.g. dialogue or lecture series, panel discussions, teach-in) exploration of
topics related to racial (in)equity, (in)justice, and movements for social change.
