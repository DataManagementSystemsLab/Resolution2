Section 2. Program Summary
In 300 or fewer words, describe the proposed program, including its purpose, content, structure and duration.

The Public Health department at SUNY Old Westbury has offered a B.S. degree in Health and Society since
1975. The mission of our program is to educate students with a social determinants of health perspective,
identifying the economic and social context within which individuals make health choices; to examine social
forces that shape individuals’ destinies; and to plan, implement, evaluate and advocate for health programs and
policies. Our students learn to understand the philosophy, history, core values, and fundamental concepts of
public health, and to apply this understanding in public health research, practice and prevention; to identify the
key components of health care systems; to define and use key epidemiological principles; to communicate
public health information orally and in writing; to conduct independent research; and to integrate ethical
practices and a social justice perspective into public health practice.
The program prepares students for entry into a broad range of public health professions at the local, state, and
national levels. Our students go on to graduate school in public health and other health-related disciplines, enter
professions in hospitals and local non-profit health agencies, and obtain training in health professions including
medicine and nursing. We are nationally accredited by the Council on Education in Public Health (CEPH). We
believe, as does CEPH, that students receive an education in public health in our program. Yet we cannot
currently call it public health. We are applying for this “new program” in order to replace the program’s name,
Health and Society.
Our 120 credit-hour B.S. degree requires students to meet all SUNY-wide and local general and liberal
education requirements, to take seven core courses and three elective courses in Public Health, and to complete
4 to 8 credits in Biology and 4 credits in Applied Statistics. Full-time students can complete our program in four
years.

Optional, Illustrative Questions to Consider:
For other SUNY campuses responding to the Program Announcement
● Do you have a similar or related program? ●What has been your experience with the program? ●Would the
introduction of this program have any effect, positive or negative, on your institution? If so, please specify. ●Do you
perceive a need for this kind of program? ●Does the program offer an opportunity for articulation or inter-institutional
cooperation?
Your response must be in writing, from your President, and addressed to the President of the proposing campus,
with a copy to the SUNY Provost at program.review@.suny.edu.
Procedure for Program Announcements (PA)
1. SCOPE. A SUNY campus must send a PA to the SUNY Provost at program.review@suny.edu before submitting
a proposal for a new program leading to an undergraduate degree. Unless requested by the SUNY Provost, a PA
is not required for a program leading to an undergraduate certificate, for a new program being created by
combining existing registered programs (e.g., multi-award programs and/or multi-institution programs), or for a
new program being created from a track, specialization, or concentration in a registered program.
2. SUNY PROVOST’S REVIEW. The SUNY Provost’s Office reviews each PA for accuracy and completeness as
well as for substantive issues, such as alignment with campus mission and SUNY policy, and requests changes
when needed.
3. PUBLICATION FOR COMMENTS. Once a PA is acceptable to the SUNY Provost, it is announced on the
SUNY Program Review listserv in a weekly Program Review Update, which starts a 30-day intra-SUNY
4 of 5

comment period. The listserv includes all campus presidents, chief academic officers, and others upon request.
The PA enables other SUNY campuses – particularly those with experience with related programs – to provide
information to the proposing campus that can be used to construct a sound program proposal.
4. COMMENTS FROM OTHER CAMPUSES. The President of each interested campus must send comments
within 30 days of a PA’s publication in the Program Review Update to the President of the proposing campus,
with a copy to the Provost at program.review@suny.edu. Comments may include advice and suggestions about
possible articulation opportunities, enrollment trends in related programs, and opportunities for cooperation, as
well as concerns or objections.
5. FOLLOWING THE COMMENT PERIOD. Once the 30-day comment period for a PA ends, and any concerns
and/or objections have been resolved, the campus may prepare a full proposal for the SUNY Provost and, when
required, begin the external evaluation process.
6. EXPIRATION. A PA expires one year after its publication in the Program Review Update. If the proposing
campus does not submit a program proposal to the SUNY Provost before a PA expires, the campus must submit
another PA to start the process again.
