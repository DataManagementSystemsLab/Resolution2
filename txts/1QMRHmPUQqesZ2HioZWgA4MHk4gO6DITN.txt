Resolution on the Name of the Faculty Judicial Committee
Whereas, the Office of Student Conduct at SUNY Old Westbury along with offices of Student Conduct
nationally are shifting away from language implying a “judicial” role, and,
Whereas, the Faculty Judicial Committee (FJC) is not a sole judicial or governing body and instead serves
to provide one third of the members of a Student Conduct Hearing Board and thus are only a portion of
the participants in determining student responsibility in conduct cases, and,
Whereas, the department within Student Affairs that manages the Student Conduct Boards changed its
name several years ago to the Office of Student Conduct to reflect the shift in the field as well as to
move away from the negative connotations of “Judicial Affairs,” and,
Whereas, the name "Judicial” implies the involvement of judge and jury in official court proceedings,
while the Student Conduct Board Hearings that involve FJC members do not try legal proceedings in a
court of law and,
Whereas, the word “Judicial” in and of itself could impact individuals that may have had negative
interactions with the law, and,
Whereas, Student Conduct Board Hearings do not hold the same standard of evidence as legal cases in a
court of law, as in most Colleges and Universities including SUNY Old Westbury these hearings require a
preponderance of evidence, and,
Whereas, along with serving on Student Conduct Board Hearings, the purpose of the Committee is to
provide feedback on the Student Code of Conduct and the language of the Committee name is crucial for
framing and informing its work,
Therefore, be it resolved the Faculty Senate approve the change in committee name from Faculty
Judicial Committee to Faculty Student Conduct Committee, pro-tem, pending Faculty Bylaws
amendment.
And be it further resolved that this name change will be codified in the revision of the Faculty Bylaws
which is currently under five-year review throughout 2021.
