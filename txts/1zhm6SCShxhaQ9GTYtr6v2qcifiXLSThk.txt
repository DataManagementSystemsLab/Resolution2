Resolution for Automatic Linkage between Pre- and Post-Requisite Course
                                Registration

            Submitted by the Academic Practices Committee, 5/8/16

Whereas, many courses throughout the College’s programs have pre-
requisites, and

Whereas, there currently exists a loophole whereby students can remain
registered for post-requisite courses even after failing to pass the
relevant pre-requisite (due to their ability to register for post-reqs
while still taking pre-reqs the previous semester), and

Whereas, this situation puts students who have failed pre-requisite courses
at an academic disadvantage in relevant post-requisite courses and
undermines the verticality of program curricula, and

Whereas, correcting for this loophole on a case-by-case basis by post-
requisite course instructors and the Registrar creates unnecessary and
additional labor for both parties that could be reduced by the feasible
introduction of appropriate programming into the registration system,

Be It Resolved that the Office of the Registrar begin the process of
implementing such programming as will automatically de-register students
for post-requisite courses if and when they fail to pass the relevant pre-
requisites, and

Be It Further Resolved that notification to affected students of such de-
registration will occur as soon as possible after their failure to pass
relevant pre-reqs, and

Be It Further Resolved that such automatic deregistration would not
supersede instructors’ discretion to allow individual students to enroll in
post-reqs despite incompletion of pre-reqs, based on consultation with the
student and their judgment.
