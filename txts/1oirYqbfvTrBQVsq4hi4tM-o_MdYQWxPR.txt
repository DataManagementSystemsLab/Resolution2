MEMORANDUM

TO:

University Faculty Senate

FROM:

Awards Committee

DATE:

October 25, 2003

RE:

Medallion

Resolution One:
Whereas the distinguished ranks are the highest ranks in SUNY; and
Whereas in academic processions academics wear regalia emblematic of their degree and
institution; and

Whereas Chancellor's Award recipients are honored with a medallion; and
Whereas no such visible symbol of the distinguished ranks is currently available; now, therefore,

be it

Resolved that SUNY award an appropriate medallion to all those who have and will attain the
rank of distinguished.
