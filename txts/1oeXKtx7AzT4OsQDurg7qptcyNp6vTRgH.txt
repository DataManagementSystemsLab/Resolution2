State University of New York
University Faculty Senate
Governance Committee
Fall Plenary Session

Maritime College
October 21-23, 2004
Proposed Resolution [re Procedure for Review of Proposals for
Change to Academic Programs and Organization]
Background:

In January2004 the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate requested the Governance Committee to
examine the issues surrounding the establishment of the School of Nanotechnology at the University at
Albany. To that end the two committee co-chairs visited the Albany campus on two occasions in February
and April 2004, meeting with faculty critical of the process and with faculty and the Dean of the School of
Nanotechnology.
As noted in the Report to the Executive Committee, there are differing perceptions on the question of
whether the governance process broke down. However, as noted in the Report, “that, by itself, indicates

that there was not a set of procedural expectations shared by the faculty leadership, the administrative
leadership, and the leadership within the School of Nanotechnology.”

A clear understanding of governance procedures by all segments of the campus community is central to the
success of the governance process, and clear and frequent communication about procedural expectations
facilitates such an understanding. To that end, the following resolution is offered:
Whereas increasing pressures upon the campuses of the university to become more responsive to the
economic development priorities of the state and the communities in which they are located, as well as

budgetary pressures to increase efficiency, make it likely that reorganizations of academic units will occur
with greater frequency than in the past, and

Whereas the organizational structure of the campus has a profound impact upon matters of research and
instruction, whose primary responsibility rests with faculty, and

Whereas a broadly understood and carefully articulated consultative process enables the faculty to
effectively discharge its governance responsibilities,
Now therefore be it Resolved:
1.

2.

that the University Faculty Senate recommends to Campus Governance Leaders that each
campus should have, within its bylaws, an explicit process for reviewing proposals for
academic reorganization; an explicit process for review, prior to the submission of proposals
to System Adminstration, of new academic programs; and an explicit process for the approval
of, and changes to, the curriculum.

that the University Faculty Senate recommends to Campus Governance Leaders that upon the

appointment of all new academic administrators (e.g., Dean, Vice President for Academic
Affairs, President), the chair of the governance body should communicate with the new

appointee, apprising the appointee of the extant process of consultation, and reminding the

3.

appointee that all changes to the process must emanate through the normal governance
mechanisms, and
that the University Faculty Senate recommends to Campus Governance Leaders that as part of
its periodic review of governance, the local governance body should review the consultative

process, and even where adequate and working well, should use the opportunity to reacquaint
the campus community with the process.
