Resolution on Changes to Language in College Policy Concerning the Consequences of
Probation
Whereas academic probation is intended as a support measure to alert students whose
academic success is in jeopardy and designed to allow them time to resolve barriers to their
studies so that they may achieve academic success; and
Whereas SUNY, NCAA, SGA, and other college organizations (Old Westbury clubs, committees,
etc.) have distinct guidelines regarding the implications of academic probation on students’
eligibility to participate; and
Whereas the current Probation, Suspension, and Dismissal Policy implies that students who
maintain a semester and cumulative GPA at or above 2.00 are eligible “to participate in college
committees or in intercollegiate athletics;” and
Whereas this statement identifies some on-campus organizations, but not others; does not
correspond accurately with the existing guidelines of some organizations regarding student
ineligibility (such as, those that require 2.5 cumulative GPA to participate); and does not allow
appropriate exceptions for student eligibility to participate in particular organizations while on
probation to be introduced;
Be it resolved that the Academic Probation policy is revised, using broader language concerning
the constraints on student activities which accompany academic probation, so as to not
contradict the existing guidelines of some college organizations, and to allow some degree of
flexibility to college organizations in determining student eligibility criteria in the future.1

Any future changes to an organization’s policy which recommends an exception to the semester and/or
cumulative GPA requirement for student participation should be approved in the form of a resolution brought
before the faculty senate.
