Minutes approved by unanimous consent

Faculty Senate Chair’s Report (J. D’Ambroise)

Meetings

Right now there are few people who want to meet in person, so at the moment, we’ll remain online. Perhaps moving forward a hybrid model 

Blue software Course Feedback

Provost suggested we could use a different software (if we don’t need all the complex usages)

Academic affairs will rank options for other software based on previous criteria- Provost will report when ranking is complete

Some faculty are interested in a committee to discuss the substantial issues of instrument design, biases, and other issues about the surveys themselves

Hanover

Collected feedback after our previous meeting, and now we’ve updated draft based on this feedback

Hanover will meet with EC to discuss survey to investigate our projects

Presidential Committees

Membership is live on the website

Agreement that committees would make minutes or documents available (being worked on)

New PRODiG appointments

Vacancy for Nominations and Elections Committee

School of business? Some historical knowledge of elections? 

Contact EC President if interested 

Presidential Chat – residential college model rename “OW Model” to reflect our identity 

There are listening sessions to engage with people, feedback, and ideas (Feb 23 and March 1 at Common Hour)

President Sams will discuss Social Justice center at next chat (March 9th)

President’s Report (T. Sams)

NSB

We have secured commitments for 1-2 phasing from builders and Chancellor  

We’ll go to market for second phase as first phase progresses

Surge: what are we using – trailers or modules? This doesn’t serve us well and perhaps this funding could be used instead to other already established campus 

Possibly building A in AV

ACADEMIC VILLAGE A: If we use this building for surge during re-building, then after construction, we can use that space for strategic vision – a Center for Social Justice, Sustainability, and Innovation

STEM and diversity

Environmental justice and green economy 

Training for new economy and in recognition of need for social justice

We will lead on these issues 

Helps students to act locally and globally – perhaps this could influence study abroad and could wrap around UN sustainability goals 

Rebirth of performing arts at OW – there is a sizable space in this building

House entrpreneurial and post-grad prep activities (Tinker center, career nights, incubator center)

Student empowerment center (erase student insecurities) – dealing with some issues like food security will keep them engaged in other areas of campus life  

House Multicultural Affairs Center

Supports plans for supporting student diversity and success 

Payment: possibly leverage some of the surge funds to re-tool during the NSB’s reconstruction 

Jeffrey Fischer-Smith (VPIA):

People are giving now (2020) up – people also give a LOT to education (after religion) but also other categories we do – environment, arts/culture, health, etc

Most of our money is from individuals (69%), 9% from bequests, and 4% from corporations 

Businesses give to advance business – how can we work with corporations for this purpose? 

Foundations 

Individual giving – this highest amount but lots of work to secure

Pareto Principles – 90-95% of funding from 10% of givers

People are interested in what you’re doing 

Questions: 

Wayne Edwards: a culture of philanthropy on campus – do we need to develop?

Response: most donors are alums, so first encounters on campus is important

Don’t discuss issues in public venues where possible donors are 

Martha Livingston: have you considered meeting with departments each month, so the departments can relay their interests 

Response: yes, his intention is to visit, will get specific funding ideas to us  

Alireza Ebrahimi: ask about funding – we are a young institution – so funding through our immediate alum or students or faculty may not net as much as other sources. How will we approach/secure funding from larger groups? 

Response: worked at two places same age as Old Westbury. Some of the funding opportunities – go into the local community

Lisa Chin: fundraising with alumni – don’t give everywhere, but where she wants to be connected – what do our alumni need to make them feel more connected? Social and academic experience? 

Response: if people give once, there is a growing likelihood they will donate again. Buy-in and notifications 

Provost’s Report (D. Quarless)

Middles States SIR (M Kavic) 

Everyone involved has advanced the process – SIR is a very specific, evidence-based document, primarily pertaining to assessment

Accreditor decides the date if there is another visit – could be this spring, could be  

General Education Framework implementation (D Lee)

Despite our response, we are now implementing the plan for new guidelines

LEC plans to present plan to FS in April and hold a vote by May and then get admin approval

Once admin approves (over summer?) programs will perform analysis and identify gaps in program that prevent us from meeting SUNY framework criteria

Fall 2022 – adding/removing classes, making domains consistent, then master schedule after Academic Affairs’ approval

Spring 2023 – updating master schedule, course catalog update, Degree works and navigate, website, banner, all areas updated

Fall 2023 – new framework in effect 

Question:

Lisa Chin: for new GedEd requirements – applying for new freshmen 2023 class, but what about current students? 

Response: there will be no loss of credits but hopefully transfer students 

Others: students go by the catalog they entered by. 

LMS migration to Brightspace (E Bever)

SUNY ending relationship with Blackboard and we’re going to Brightspace (Calendar year 2022)

All classes in 2022 will be Brightspace

Possibly by April we’ll have access 

Students will be trained in May

Weekly training at several points in the spring and summer (SUNY will also offer synchronous and asynchronous training)

Haven’t figured out about mass migration

But there is a website – SUNY Old Westbury – search “LMS”

Setting up an advisory committee 

Sandbox version available 

Questions:

Runi Mukherji: will there be mass migration of our materials?

Response: not sure

Lisa Chin: campus-based training in person or hybrid?

Response: all on Zoom, also on campus training (Lisa Cuccia)

Face-to-face OW and content delivery from D2L 

Robert Mevissen: does the sandbox version allow us to save progress and migrate content?

Response: yes

UUP Report (M. Livingston)

Announcements: UUP and CUP – march over Brooklyn bridge to Manhattan for funding for New York higher education 

Need to have more consistent classroom observations / performance program

Issue of workload creep – faculty (particularly pre-tenure) are working hard and have less time for professional work 

COVID still need to take precautions

Issue of pension contributions – tracking and will ensure everyone gets what they desire

Adjuncts – perhaps discussing longer contracts for those who have been here a while to help avoid issues like adjuncts not getting paid 

University Faculty Senate Report (L. Morris)

Interim chancellor attended the winter session and Tisch reported that the next chancellor will be chosen after nation-wide search (not selected)

Enrollment concerns: first-years and seniors, a lot of concern that campuses will be closed 

Pretty good shape for budget because of covid funding for past few years

Such good share that governor asked for more money for agenda items rather than things that would have been cut 

Hoping to get all we ask for (from legislature) 

Highlights: construction projects, new hires, money for child care, employee benefits, 

Reducing costs and making more sustainable – perhaps pushing green projects 

Concerns:

Hospitals, aging infrastructure on campus 

Enrollment: clearly, enrollment is going down, but mostly because of comprehensive college and community colleges

University and doctoral centers are fine, tech centers are generally stable, comprehensive college 

Discussed collaborative relationships to secure additional funding

Most of our competitors are far outspending us in advertisement 

GenEd: the Diversity, Equity Inclusion has generated most discussion at senate, perhaps because of less diverse campuses upstate 

Migration to D2L – we’re cohort 1

Two resolutions: 

Ensure campuses and leaders are aware of difficulty for under-represented communities to be hired and remain in positions. So want campuses to consider DEI principles in their hiring/re-hiring practices 

Ensure that campus body representatives do what is necessary (hiring new full time faculty) to help faculty offer GenEd courses in new Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Social Justice GedEd requirement

Enrollment Report (M. Calzolari)

Strategies to counter the enrollment trends (want to get back up to 48-5200)

Continuing/undergrads make up 70%, with First-Year, Grad about 30%

Competition from other colleges like CUNY or other SUNY campuses (a few also local community college) 

Faculty are best ambassadors: keep the 70% who are enrolled, try to recruit new students 

Art gallery exhibits

School of Ed events

Open houses and classroom visits

Starting welcome events earlier 

Hanover research will help 

Could tap NYC and five boroughs for students – most of our commuters come from neighboring counties (Suffolk and Nassau)

Recruited in boroughs, including Harlem, sent recruiters to Buffalo, Syracuse, and Rochester, as well as to Hispanic College fairs in NJ and PA, and trying to attract students interested in 

Questions:

Manya Mascareno: Are there any residential scholarships? 

Response: yes, some, and we are trying to use judiciously 

Roger Mayer: many of students in SOB are transfer students from local colleges. Significantly hit by COVID. Have you incorporated in analysis/strategies to our feeder colleges? Also, what about graduate programs? 

Response: some of these we can see in other presentations, but 12% of new students are grad students, so we need to work on recruiting (tuition remission from corporations and other things). There are many community colleges that we could be visiting to attract students, not just the local places 

Alireza Ebrahimi: seems like SUNY policies make it hard to get out-of-state and international students 

Response: yes, how do we compare the value of our 

Runi Mukherji: adult learners? 

SGA Report (O. Ogunlade)

Election time is here – applications to join SGA due next week

Hosting Panther Collective meeting next month, April, and May

Place to collaborate with student leaders 	

Getting feminine products throughout campus bathrooms

Fliers and posters to advertise> fatigue with digital world, word-of-mouth

Desire to increase student activity fee/ not just mandatory to help fund programming – be able to do more for students 

Questions:

Lisa China: how much of an increase are you asking?

Response: increase to around $100 or $105 (maybe $12-15 increase)
