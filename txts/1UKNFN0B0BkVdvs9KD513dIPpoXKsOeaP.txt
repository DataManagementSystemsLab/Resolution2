Resolution on the Conduct of Senate Meetings
2/27/18 – as revised and approved, 4/27/18
Whereas, the Faculty, Staff, and Students devote time to the Senate meetings do so on a
volunteer basis, and
Whereas, the demands on faculty time, duties, and responsibilities are many and varied, and
Whereas, effective meetings offer the prospect of deeper and broader engagement and the
resolution of issues, therefore
Be it Resolved that,
Reports from Standing Committees of the Senate shall be incorporated as a recurring part of
Senate meeting agendas, and shall receive priority in the development of each meeting’s
agenda, and
In order to be included on the agenda for a Senate meeting, those responsible for making a
formal report, update, committee report, or other presentation shall provide electronic
written reports and/or documentation at least one week prior to a meeting of the Faculty
Senate, to be distributed to the Senate in a timely manner; absent such prior
documentation, reports will not be included in the Agenda, and
In order to be included on the agenda for discussion at a Senate meeting, reports, updates,
resolutions, or other presentations shall include one or more specific action items to be
taken up by the Senate, and
Reports and presentations that are primarily for the purposes of sharing information shall be
restricted to Q & A for the time allotted, rather than for open discussion or “oral
presentations” of the written content, and
The Senate shall adopt a general policy of prioritizing members speaking to new perspectives
on an issue under discussion, as well as new voices in the discussion, and
These rules of conduct may be suspended by a majority vote of the Senate or by the Executive
Committee, for special reports or issues of a time-sensitive nature.
Submitted for consideration by Jacob Heller, Sociology Department Senator
