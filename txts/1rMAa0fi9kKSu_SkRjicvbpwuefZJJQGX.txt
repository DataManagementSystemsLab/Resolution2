OER Community Course
Professional Development Series
New for Fall 2018: the SUNY OER Community Courses will introduce you to the
fundamental principles and effective practices related to Open Educational Resources.

Six independent mini-courses allow you to focus on specifically the aspect of OER that
most appeals to your interests. Content is designed to serve the needs of faculty,
librarians, instructional designers, and others across SUNY who are teaching or
supporting OER efforts on their campus.

While we encourage those new to open educational resources to start with either the
“Understanding OER" or "Open Pedagogy Master Class” sections, any participant is

welcome to jump in to start at any appealing point.

Commons licensing, available in multiple formats for local adoption, and open for anyone
