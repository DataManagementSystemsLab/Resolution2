OFFICE OF ACADEMIC AFFAIRS
Faculty DSI Report 2003

Process

Office of Academic Affairs established an Ad Hoc DSI Committee with Bob Hoyte
as Chair. Other members included L. Anker, J. Biondo, R. Colon-Urban J.
Conforti, J. Fernandez, and C. Griffin.

Faculty deadline for submission was September 26, 2003.
DSI Committee recommendations were submitted to AVP’s office on Friday,
October 24, 2003. The DSI Committee only considered merit.

Three person Committee in Office of Academic Affairs (Cox, Gonzalez, Welton)
reviewed all recommendations of the DSI Committee. The DSI Committee had

grouped their recommendations into four categories: Recommended with High
Enthusiasm, Recommended, Recommended with Low Enthusiasm, and Not

Recommended.

Office of Academic Affairs submitted its recommendations for merit awards on
October 29, 2003 to President Butts’ office.

Equity recommendations for faculty were determined by a Committee of three

(Kimmins, Davis, Welton) based on a disparity analysis of all faculty salaries
using multiple-regression.

Dr. Butts makes all final decisions based on the recommendations for both merit
and equity. In order to qualify for an equity award- faculty must have earned a
merit award, i.e. there is no equity award without merit.
Dr. Butts has agreed that fixed dollar amounts will be awarded for both equity
and merit awards for faculty.
Final comment: The Office of Academic Affairs followed the recommendations of the
DSI Committee in 100% of the cases. Of the 64 submissions, 17.2% were ranked 5,
51.6% were ranked 4, 17.2% were ranked 3, and 14% were not recommended.
Hence, about 86% were recommended for a merit award.
