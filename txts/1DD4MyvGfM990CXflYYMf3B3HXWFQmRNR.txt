2003-04 Budget Request

| recommend that the Board of Trustees adopt the following resolution:

Whereas, the State of New York continues to face a significant and

unprecedented budget challenge following the September 11, 2001

attacks and the ongoing national economic slowdown and, as a result, has

asked all State agencies to restrain tax-supported spending, and

Whereas, the University is requesting funds within the guidelines set forth
in the September 20, 2002 letter from the Director of the Budget which
calls for budget requests that hold tax supported spending to current-year

levels, be it,

Resolved that the proposed budget request for State-Operated and

Statutory Colleges and the Community Colleges (copy on file with these
minutes in the Office of the Secretary) be, and hereby is, approved for the

And,

Whereas, the above request represents a continuation of the existing
level of State support and University income, and

Whereas, additional funding from University income would enable the

State University of New York to meet rising costs and continue to improve
services to students and faculty, and
Whereas, the State University would use additional resources to meet the

rising costs of continuing current operations including collective
bargaining, prior year enrollment growth at both the state-operated and

community colleges, quality improvement initiatives, rental aid, inflation

and campus development funds; and

Whereas, the tuition rate for New York State resident, baccalaureate
students has remained unchanged at $3,400 per year since 1995, and, if
this rate had kept pace with the Higher Education Price Index and public

Be
tuition rates nationally, annual tuition would range from $4,600 to $5,400
by fall of 2003, and

Whereas, because of the continuing economic and budgetary challenges
facing New York State, there is a widespread expectation that State

budget support for virtually all programs will be reduced from current
levels, and
Whereas, a mid-year budget reduction has already been imposed on
State agencies, including the State University’s State Operations budget
and this reduction is expected to be continued at greater amounts in the
subsequent fiscal year, be it
Resolved, that in order to meet the costs of current operations and

preserve gains in academic quality, the State University requests that its
total Core Instructional Budget revenue from State support and University
tuition revenue remain at the current year’s level.

In order to maintain the

existing total level of the Core Instructional Budget, the State University
requests an appropriation sufficient to expend additional revenue

resulting from an increase in non-community college tuition rates of up to
$1,400 per year for New York State resident, baccalaureate students at

State-operated campuses with commensurate increases in other tuition
categories should such an increase prove necessary and appropriate.
