RATIONALE:
WHEREAS​ Standard VII of the Middle States Commission on Higher Education Standards for Accreditation

and transparent governance structure that outlines roles, responsibilities, and accountability for decision
making by each constituency, including governing body, administration, faculty, staﬀ and students”; and
WHEREAS​ SUNY campuses are experiencing extraordinary financial deficits due in large part to the COVID
crisis; and

the need to act quickly in response to the COVID-19 crisis; and
WHEREAS​ United University Professions has strongly advocated for monitoring and maintaining healthy
campus communities and work environments for faculty, staff, and students in the SUNY system, including
proactive measures to minimize spread of the COVID-19 virus, testing requirements to monitor the health of
campus communities, and processes for addressing COVID-19 positive employees and students; and
WHEREAS​ the process for approval of changes in academic programs is a matter of special responsibility of
the faculty with guidelines typically contained in faculty bylaws; and

ensure that appropriate structures and bylaws are in place to expedite shared governance work during crisis
situations;
