SUNY Old Westbury Faculty Senate
Resolution on Proposal for SPAAR Committee
Whereas, the Old Westbury Strategic Plan 2018-2023 was developed from Fall 2016 to Spring 2018, through joint effort
of faculty and administration, involving 70 members of the campus community, including the Faculty Senate Chair who
served as Co-Chair of the Strategic Planning Process; and,
Whereas, in Fall 2018, faculty representatives were selected through governance for appointment to the SPAAR Task
Force, charged with developing a proposal for a college-wide body (Strategic Plan Analysis, Assessment and Review
Committee) to be responsible for monitoring the college’s progress in implementing the Strategic Plan and associated
budgeting activities; and,
Whereas, Faculty Senate recognizes the importance of aligning strategic planning with effective operations and effective
allocation of resources in the advancement of the college’s mission and goals, and affirms the historic and essential role of
faculty in college-wide planning and budgeting endeavors1; and,
Whereas, for nearly three decades, Faculty Senate has played an active role in selecting the faculty who would represent
governance in various institutional planning and budgeting endeavors (some but not all of which were codified as collegewide committees in the Faculty Bylaws Appendix); and,
Whereas, the SPAAR Task Force completed its proposal for SPAAR Committee, in the form of a 3-page document dated
December 17, 2018, which includes the proposed Charge, Structure and Composition, Criteria and Selection Process; and,
Whereas, President Butts in his January 4th memo to the Chair of Faculty Senate, acknowledges the work of the SPAAR
Task Force, and presents the document to be viewed by the Faculty Senate, with the understanding that there may be
questions or proposed revisions to the document; therefore
Be It Resolved, that the Faculty Senate accepts the SPAAR Task Force Proposal for the SPAAR Committee, and
acknowledges the efforts of those faculty who worked on the Task Force, acknowledging as well the efforts of all those
who participated in or helped to steer development of the college’s Strategic Plan 2018-2023; and,
Be It Further Resolved, that the Faculty Senate, in consideration of past practice, supports its stated role in the [initial]
selection of faculty representatives to the SPAAR Committee, as described on page 3 of the proposal, under Criteria and
Process for Selection (second bullet); and
Be It Further Resolved, that the Faculty Senate affirms its expectation that the faculty representatives on the SPAAR
Committee will solicit input from the Senate and the faculty, and will provide regular feedback to the Senate on the
implementation of the Strategic Plan, including the committee’s recommendations on priorities, resources, analyses and
review of the effectiveness with which the committee is able to fulfill its charge; and,
Be It Further Resolved, that the Faculty Senate, consistent with past practice in codifying prior budget and planning
committees for inclusion in the Bylaws, supports the convening of a Bylaws Working Group on SPAARC to undertake
the appropriate process for establishing SPAAR Committee as a college-wide committee in the Appendix of the Faculty
Bylaws (to replace RABPC), and recommends that the Bylaws Working Group to be established as a subcommittee of
FRRC include the Faculty Senate Chair or designee and representative(s) from SPAARC; and,
Be It Further Resolved, that the Bylaws Working Group on SPAARC may recommend appropriate revisions to the
Proposal for the SPAAR Committee, in consideration of past practice and due diligence in preparing for submission to the
Senate and the Faculty for approval, a new college-wide committee for inclusion in the Appendix of the Faculty Bylaws.
