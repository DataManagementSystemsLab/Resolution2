Proposal for Minor in African American Studies

Sponsoring Departments:

American Studies and Humanities & Languages

The minor in African American Studies is designed to critically engage students in the historical,
cultural, and socio-political aspects of American and African American life in the United States.
Positing that Africa in general terms is the historical homeland of Blacks in the Diaspora, this
interdisciplinary minor brings together scholars who are concemed with the African Diaspora,
Africa and Black America with a view to exposing students to the interdisciplinary intersections
between and among such and other disciplinary endeavors of study.

A primary purpose of this

minor is that it prepares students for life in an increasingly multi-ethnic and global society, for
eventual explorations in graduate study and for professional careers in community service,
education, government, law and private industry.

The minor requires a total of five courses, (20 credits), four of which must be taken from outside
the student's major courses.

Two courses may be transferred from another institution of higher

learning. Only one 2000 level course or below is accepted toward the minor. A GPA of at least
2.00 is required for graduation, and no D grades will be counted toward the minor.

A foundation course will provide students with the pivotal underpinnings in this multi disciplinary
area of study.

Additional courses will be taken from the following areas:

A.

History

Literature

B. Culture/Social Institutions
