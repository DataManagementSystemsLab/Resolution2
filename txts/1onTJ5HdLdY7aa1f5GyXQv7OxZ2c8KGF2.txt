     Resolution—Combined B.A. (or B.S.) in Chemistry/M.A.T. in Chemistry
                           /Adolescence Education

WHEREAS,    The School of Education  and  Chemistry  Department  have  found
          significant student interest in a 5 year program that will  result
          in a combined  Bachelor  of  Arts  (of  Bachelor  of  Science)  in
          Chemistry and Master of Arts in Teaching   Chemistry  /Adolescence
          Education, and

WHEREAS,    The proposed 5  year  program  combines  two  existing  programs
          (Bachelor of Arts (or Bachelor of Science) in Chemistry and Master
          of Arts in Teaching Chemistry /Adolescence Education) into  one  5
          year combined program, and

WHEREAS,    The proposed 5 year  combined  B.A.(or  B.S.)/M.A.T  will  allow
          highly qualified students to complete both a Bachelor of Arts  (or
          Bachelor of Science) degree in Chemistry and a Master of  Arts  in
          Teaching Chemistry/ Adolescence Education degree  in  5  years  by
          accelerating undergraduate coursework and taking graduate  courses
          in their 4th year of study, and

WHEREAS,    The proposed 5 year program consists entirely  of  courses  that
          are already offered in the School of Education curriculum and  the
          curriculum of other departments involved  in  this  program,  thus
          mitigating the need for any additional resources, and

WHEREAS,    The proposed 5 year program allows students to fulfill  the  New
          York State requirement of obtaining a Masters degree in  order  to
          qualify for their teaching certification, and

WHEREAS,    The School  of  Education  has  determined  that  students  with
          Masters degrees have a higher  passing  rate  on  New  York  State
          teaching certification examinations.


THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED

      That the Senate approves the proposed Combined Bachelor  of  Arts  (or
          Bachelor of Science) in Chemistry/  Master  of  Arts  in  Teaching
          Chemistry/ Adolescence Education program.

                     Approved by CAP for submission to Senate, March 6, 2015
