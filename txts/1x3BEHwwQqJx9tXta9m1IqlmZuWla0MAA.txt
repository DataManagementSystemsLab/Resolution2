      separate awards  (e.g.,  A.S./B.A.,  B.S./M.S.).   Complete  Part  2A,
      below.    NOTE:  Such programs generally  involve  special  admissions

      degree compared to taking the programs separately.

 [    ]     This proposal is for a multi-institution program (also called  a
      “jointly registered program”) to be offered jointly  by  two  or  more
      institutions.  Complete Part B, below.   NOTE:  Such programs  involve
      a formal agreement between two or more institutions to  offer  courses
      leading to an award.

|         |Spanish Adolescence Education    |          |                 |


i) List all the courses required for each  existing  program,  and  indicate
   which ones will be counted toward both awards.  See attachment 1
j) How long will it take for full-time students  to  complete  the  proposed
   program?  5 years
k) What are the admissions requirements for the new  program,  and  how  are
   they related to student success?
      Candidates must apply for the program by the end of Junior year. They
      must have 12 credits of residency.  All candidates must show a GPA of
      3.25 overall and 3.25 in the courses required for the Spanish B.A.
      degree.  An interview is required.
      Transfer students ‘GPA must meet Old Westbury’s GPA requirements and
      transfer courses must be calculated along with Old Westbury grades for
      admission to this program.




      Candidates must submit an application that includes
       • An essay
       • GRE scores
       • Two letters of reference from faculty
       • All college transcripts


      Highly qualified candidates will complete the program in five years by
      accelerating undergraduate coursework, and moving on to graduate study
      in the fourth year.   Candidates must maintain a GPA of 3.25 (overall
      and in the major) in each semester of study.  Additionally, no grades
      of D are permitted for any required courses, and candidates must meet
      requirements of the Spanish major (no grades below C in the major).
      Those whose GPA falls below 3.25 will be placed on probation and will
      have one semester to bring up their grades.    Candidates who fail to
      complete the five-year program will be administratively transferred
      into the Spanish major, and will graduate with the B.A. degree.


l) Complete a SUNY Sample Program Schedule to  show  how  students  will  be
   able to  schedule  all  required  courses  to  complete  the  multi-award
   program.

|For programs leading to initial certification, list all pedagogical courses in the|
|proposed program in the Pedagogical Core Courses table below.   The Pedagogical   |
|Core Courses Table is designed for a program leading to a single certificate or   |
|multiple certificates. See example on Pedagogical Core Courses Table for an       |
|inclusive childhood education program leading to Childhood Education 1-6 (Cert    |
|Code: 02) and Teaching Students with Disabilities 1-6 (Cert Code: 06).            |
|                                                                                  |

|In the first four columns, identify each pedagogical course by course number,     |
|title, number of credits, required (R) or elective (E), and the                   |
|instructor(s)/status (full-time or part-time). See example on Pedagogical Core    |
|Courses Table.                                                                    |

|Step 2:                                                                           |
|Use the Certification Area Codes listed immediately below to identify the         |
|certificate area(s) the program leads to and insert the certificate area number   |
|code(s) in the Cert Code column(s). For example, if a program prepares candidates |
|for certification in Childhood Education 1-6 and Teaching Students with           |
|Disabilities Childhood 1-6, mark 02 and 06 in the Cert Code columns. See example  |
|on Pedagogical Core Courses Table.                                                |
