Grant Critique Weaknesses: Examples

Training Grant Critiques (RISE) 2018

“

Most of the research faculty at SUNY OW have limited funding 

– mainly internal funds.”

“There is concern that the 

present research environment at SUNY OW is weak 

and may struggle to provide meaningful research experiences.”

“There are letters of support from SUNY-OW, but they are underwhelming.”

“Given the low graduation rates and the low number of students that currently go to PhD programs, there 

does not appear to be a culture of research 

at SUNY-OW.”

Independent Grant Critiques (R15) 2018

“The PI has not demonstrated a 

track record exposing students to more sophisticated environments

 such as proposed in this application. It is unclear if this could be accomplished in the current application.” 

“The animal studies (Aim 3) will be carried out at Drexel University College of Medicine. 

It is unclear how this part of project would benefit undergraduate students at SUNY Old Westbury

.” 

Current 

Working Conditions 

of 

the NSB

Current Working Conditions of The NSB: Growing Pains & Space Limitation Concerns

NSB 40 years old

Space not sufficient for: 

Biology, chemistry, biochemistry, bioinformatics and computational science, and public health majors 

Research: biology, chemistry, and biopsychology research 

Exceeded estimated growth by 3 years

 (i.e., current growth rate was projected to happen in 2024)

Current State of NSB: Concerns 

Note: minor issues not fixed due to ‘building will be renovated soon’

Current State of NSB Unsustainable

*

Post-renovation would be the same ratio without an addition

^Have separate Biology, Chemistry and other science buildings and/or Core Facilities

CHANGE IN PLANS

  Timeline of NSB Renovation 

Concerns: Original Renovation Options

*Trailers for labs and research (~17 mil)

Concerns: Revised Renovation Plan

Only Phase 1 guaranteed (survey taken back in 2014).

Reduced Teaching Laboratory Space after Phase 1 only

Indeterminate start of Phase 2

Alternate location for Teaching Labs during Phase 1 uses 

capital budget and college funds 

for:

Renovate E-wing (space reserved for IT)

Trailers ~4+ years without consideration for phase 2

Designer for exterior of building.

APPEAL

Prioritize renovation of NSB 

Continue to increase URM representation in STEM​

Continue to drive enrollment ​

Expand revenue stream through external grants and endowments.​

Add a building extension to expand lab space

Surge space for Renovation instead of temporary spaces during renovation.​

Accommodate enrollment growth​

Accommodate CURE and applied learning across science curriculum.​

Single phase

 

renovation

 

for NSB

Expedited construction time: least disruptive​

Standardization of materials for the whole building.

Funding for new equipment in the new and renovated building

No trailers : Capital can be used for permanent improvement

Reassign available office space and lecture halls in NAB and CC during Renovation. 

APPEAL

Support OW mission to serve URM.

Appeal to SUNY to augment support for SUNY OW.

Appeal to Governor to augment support for SUNY OW CAPITAL PROJECTS

Raise funds from OW Foundation: 

a serious and actionable fund-raising plan to increase the college's endowment and enlist partners for the renovation project.
