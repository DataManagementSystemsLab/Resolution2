RATIONALE:
WHEREAS the SUNY Board of Trustees September 10, 2015 Resolution “Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion Policy” desires to “make SUNY the most inclusive higher education system in the
country”; and
WHEREAS SUNY seeks to be respectful of all members of our community; and
WHEREAS SUNY respects each person’s right to determine their own identity; and
WHEREAS transgender matters have gained increasing attention in recent years, and
academic writing and communications can better reflect a range of gender identities and be
inclusive of transgender people; and
WHEREAS most notably, the use of male and female pronouns (he/him/his, she/her/hers) is
being challenged, and many argue for the acceptance and use of they (i.e. not s/he, which is
still based on a binary notion of gender) as an epicene—a gender-neutral singular pronoun:
RESOLUTION:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the UFS requests the Chancellor to require genderneutral pronouns they/their/theirs be used instead of the current practice of using gender
specific pronouns he/she in all SUNY communications from the Chancellor’s office or system
administration, such as websites, policy documents, press materials, reports, recruiting
materials, etc.
