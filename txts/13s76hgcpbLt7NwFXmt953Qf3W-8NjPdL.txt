Resolution on Departmental Authority
          in Non-Rehiring Decisions Relating to Contingent Faculty


Whereas, as prescribed in the Policies of the Board of Trustees, Article X,
Paragraph 4, the Faculty of the College "shall have the obligation to
participate significantly in the initiation, development, and
implementation of the educational program,"
 
Whereas, the faculty is responsible for implementation of the College’s
academic curriculum,
 
Whereas, academic departments, as represented by their chairs, bear
immediate responsibility for the searching, hiring, orienting and
supervising contingent faculty, and the staffing of their courses,
 
Whereas, the faculty is committed to an inclusive system that is
transparent and provides due process,
 
Be it resolved that in those situations where an academic department is
satisfied with the performance of a contingent faculty member, and is
planning to re-hire that contingent faculty member for the following
semester, the administration will honor chairs’ and departments’ hiring
decisions except in extraordinary circumstances.

In such extraordinary circumstances, if the administration is considering
not rehiring a contingent faculty member, the administration will provide
details of the circumstances and provide said faculty member with the
opportunity to defend herself or himself. 

Be it further resolved that the administration develop a mechanism to
communicate potential actions of this kind in a timely manner to the
relevant department, so as to allow for the faculty member and the
department the opportunity to hear cause and respond.
