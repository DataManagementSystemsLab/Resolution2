Resolution on EC Elections					

Overview:

Bylaws specify that annual election of EC members (Vice Chair, Secretary/Treasurer and At Large Representative to EC) will occur during a meeting of Faculty Senate no later than September 15th

Faculty Senate Chair is elected at end of previous academic year, no later than June 15th 

SUNY Senator is elected every 3 years during regular election cycle. 

The Parliamentarian is appointed by the Chair (and may serve under various Chairs)

Additional (2nd) At Large Representative to the EC (refer Article V: section G) 

Nomination/election of additional (2nd) At Large Rep to EC is pending outcome of Resolution.

Precedent exists for Senate approval of additional At Large Representative to EC (2020-2021)

Rationale stated in Resolution is based on evolution and increase in EC responsibilities, use of technology and electronic media, and overall growth in programs, FTE and shared governance. 

Expansion of Eligibility Criteria (refer Article V: section D and section B line 8)

The expansion (broadening) of eligibility criteria for Secretary/Treasurer position and the At-Large Representative(s) to the Executive Committee is also pending the outcome of resolution.

Vice Chair nominee(s) must meet eligibility criteria for Chair-Elect (i.e., faculty Senator of academic rank.)

Precedent exists for nomination and election to the EC of contingent faculty and UUP professionals. 

Alternates have not, to date, been eligible for nomination/election to the EC, during three decades of Faculty Senate governance structure.

Precedent exists for Senate service by alternates, contingent faculty and UUP professionals as temporary note-takers, although such service to Senate did not entail election to the EC.

Rationale stated in Resolution, for expansion of eligibility criteria, cites increased participation and attendance by alternates and senators at Senate and Faculty meetings held remotely (since Spring 2020).
