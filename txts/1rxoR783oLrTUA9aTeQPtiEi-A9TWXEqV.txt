CURRICULUM AND ACADEMIC PLANNING (CAP) COMMITTEE
Guidelines for Submitting Faculty Line Requests
2019-2020
Departments may submit proposals to request new or replacement faculty lines, via email
to the CAP chair, Amanda Frisken (friskena@oldwestbury.edu), by Monday, April 20,
2020. As directed by the Faculty Bylaws, CAP will review all submissions on the basis of
the criteria outlined below, so as to make recommendations to the Provost for new faculty
hires. Although advisory in nature, CAP’s recognition of urgent need can provide support
for department requests for faculty lines. This helps retain the faculty’s central role in
decisions affecting the College curriculum.
Please outline your reasons for the new line in response to the prompts below. Keep
responses brief and evidence-based (referencing supporting documents or links as
appropriate), and your proposal to a maximum of 5 pages.
Provide position description, in roughly 150 words.
