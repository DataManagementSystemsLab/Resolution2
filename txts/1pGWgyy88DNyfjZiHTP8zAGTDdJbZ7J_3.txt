II. Activities
The TLRC continues to work to provide teaching development opportunities and resources, create spaces that
foster faculty connections, and address teaching-related issues as they arise.
During the COVID altered 2019-2020 academic year, the TLRC hosted a fall New Faculty Orientation focused on
teaching-issues for 11 new full-time faculty, and hosted four roundtable discussions (with 2 more roundtables and
the end of the year conference cancelled due to COVID). Furthermore, the TLRC supported events by CETL, OER,
and the end of the year Academic Affairs “Lessons Learned” discussions. The TLRC collaborated with CETL to
procure the Monday Morning Mentor subscription for the school and to implement the Poverty Simulation, the
Poverty Simulation Facilitation Training, and a follow-up reflection roundtable discussion on the Poverty Simulation.
The TLRC co-sponsored UUP’s annual “Getting to Tenure and Beyond” workshop. Furthermore, the TLRC cosponsored OER’s Teaching and Learning with Open Educational Resources roundtable. In addition to these activities
(also listed below), the TLRC held a total of five business meetings (3 first semester, 2 in the COVID altered second
semester), along with regular online discussions.
The committee continued to serve in an advisory capacity to the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning
(CETL) in its second full year of activity and represented faculty needs on the Instructional Contingency Planning
Committee.
Please note that members of the TLRC rely heavily on the expertise and participation of our colleagues to develop
successful initiatives, and always welcome suggestions/volunteers for presenters.
