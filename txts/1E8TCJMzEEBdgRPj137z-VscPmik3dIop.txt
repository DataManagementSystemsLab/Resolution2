Resolution: Adjunct Faculty Compensation Increase for Extraordinary
Service during the Pandemic.
Whereas, adjunct and contingent faculty face deep salary inequities and insufficient compensation for
the work that they do. Old Westbury adjunct and contingent faculty live in one of the nation’s most
expensive housing regions, but their compensation, as indicated in the September 13, 2018 SUNY Board
of Trustees memo just meets national averages for pay for four-year public institutions, according to the
Chronicle of Higher Education. https://data.chronicle.com/category/sector/1/adjunct-salaries/

Whereas, the Coronavirus, Covid-19 State of New York “pause” occasioned Old Westbury professors to
redesign courses in two weeks (including one week of spring break) to accomplish distance learning.
Course redesign forced extraordinary workload for our lowest-paid, least secure faculty, including:

•
•
•
•

•

revising all syllabi to meet the needs of going online for a student body,
scanning course materials, or identifying new course materials that could be shared on Learning
Management Systems,
uploading all such new materials,
attending meetings and trainings to learn new skills such as synchronous meeting via BlackBoard
Collaborate, with whiteboard, slide shows, and chats, and asynchronous slide shows, testing,
grading, development of discussion boards, and recorded lectures,
creating new course materials to substitute for face-to-face teaching, such as discussion board
questions, slide shows, recorded lectures;

Whereas adjunct faculty from multiple departments have testified to the major increase in workload,
even those faculty who are well familiar with online teaching (see attached statements);

Whereas effective online teaching requires increased workload, including daily course management
duties and communications with students;

Whereas most distance learning and online learning has previously required months of trainings, and
typically provided a stipend;

Whereas the traumas of the pandemic are affecting Old Westbury’s student body, and faculty,
including contingent faculty are responding to students’ distress by reaching out to students at the
request of the Provost;

Whereas the college’s successful handing of this crisis requires attention to retention and supporting
students in need through increased outreach, interaction and feedback;

Whereas many contingent faculty have incurred additional expenses as a result of the move to online
education, including special equipment, home office equipment, even WIFI access. Equipment many
might assume would be normative for faculty might not be for contingent faculty whose living budgets
are extraordinarily low;

Whereas the College is in receipt of $2.7 million in CARES funding which could be appropriately used for
this purpose; and

Therefore, be it resolved that Old Westbury contingent faculty receive a $1,000 one-time payment
per class for their extraordinary efforts over the spring of 2020.
