Created list of Courses in the catalog which have not been offered recently (see Courselast.xlsx)
The CAP committee with data obtained from Kuldeep Pupala compiled a list of all courses currently in
the catalog and their most recent offering. The data went from 1994 to Spring 2017.
Assuming the data is correct there are several courses in the printed catalog that have not been offered
in a long time. CAP asked the departments (in a FS meeting) to look at the selection of courses that are
in the printed catalog and to decide whether or not to keep the course in the printed catalog. Some
examples are below.
● the course PE3425 Economic Analysis-Micro was las offered in Fall of 1995. However, the PEL
department may wish to keep this course as it is required for a new minor just approved.
● The course CS1510 Advanced Computer Applications was last offered Fall 2002. The Math and
CIS department may wish to delete this course from the printed catalog.
CAP makes no suggestion as to keep or to eliminate a course. We only ask each department consider
why a course has not been offered in a long period of time.
