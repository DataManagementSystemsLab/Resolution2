MEMORANDUM
May 6, 2020
TO:

Members of the Board of Trustees

FROM:

Kristina M. Johnson, Chancellor

SUBJECT:

Authorizing additional year to service limit to continuing
appointment for current non-tenured faculty

Action Requested
This resolution would authorize emergency rulemaking to allow for the
addition of one year to the service limits for current faculty to attain continuing
appointment.
This resolution would amend the corresponding Policies of the SUNY Board
of Trustees.

Resolution
I recommend that the Board of Trustees adopt the following
resolution:
Whereas, the global public health crisis surrounding the
COVID-19 disease outbreak has forced the alteration of the
traditional campus-based higher education structure and
caused SUNY institutions to transition to a remote learning
platform; and
Whereas, the COVID-19 disease outbreak has caused
significant disruption to the careers of SUNY faculty, and
most significantly to those faculty working toward
achievement of continuing appointment (tenure); and
Whereas, under Article XI of the Policies of the Board of
Trustees, the Board of Trustees has established the steps
necessary for faculty to achieve continuing appointment, and
limited the number of years of employment that faculty may
serve prior to achieving continuing appointment; and

Whereas, the Board of Trustees wishes to amend Article XI
of its Policies, which is also codified in its regulations, in the
face of the ongoing public health crisis to provide necessary
flexibility to our faculty in this uncertain time; now therefore,
be it
Resolved that the Chancellor, or designee, be, and hereby
is, authorized and directed to prepare, in accordance with
the provisions of the State Administrative Procedure Act, a
Notice of Emergency Adoption and Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking, as well as any re-issuance of such Notice of
Emergency Adoption as may be necessary during the
pendency of the Proposed Rulemaking, with respect to
amendments to subdivision d of section 335.4 of Title 8 of
the Official Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations of
the State of New York, and to amend corresponding
provisions of the Policies of the Board of Trustees, to read
as follows (brackets denote old material to be deleted;
underlining denotes new material to be added):

(4) Each employee who as of May 6, 2020 is currently
serving in a position of academic rank who has not yet
attained continuing appointment status, and who is not
currently under review, shall have an automatic one-year
extension of the time to continuing appointment without
change in title, full-time equivalent or other employment
status. Any employee in a position of academic rank who
has not yet attained continuing appointment status may opt
out of the automatic one-year extension referenced above
and be considered for continuing appointment based on their
original schedule by submitting a request, in writing, to their
Department Chair, with copy to their Dean and Provost.
Timelines for such submission shall be determined at each
campus. These provisions shall not apply to any employee
in a position of academic rank who has already been
provided with a notice of non-renewal.

and, be it further
Resolved that the Chancellor, or designee, be, and hereby
is, authorized to adopt or amend policies, procedures, and/or

guidelines in accordance with these regulations; and, be it
further
Resolved that the amendments made to policies,
procedures, and/or guidelines in accordance with these
regulations shall be repealed upon the repeal of the
amendments to Title 8 of the Official Compilation of Codes,
Rules and Regulations of the State of New York made
herein, and such policies, procedures, and/or guidelines
revised and updated consistent with such repeal.

Background
SUNY’s Policies of the Board of Trustees and corresponding regulatory
provisions require that those SUNY employees appointed to the academic ranks
of professor, associate professor, librarian, or associate librarian be granted
continuing appointment (tenure) by the chancellor by the end of the third
consecutive year of service in that position, otherwise employment is not
continued. For those serving in the academic ranks of assistant professor,
instructor, senior assistant librarian, or assistant librarian, the maximum allowable
time to continuing appointment is seven years.
The current ongoing public health crisis has caused significant disruption to
the traditional academic calendar and operations. This has left many SUNY faculty
seeking continuing appointment with disruption in their academic progress toward
achieving tenure. Given this significant disruption, SUNY has reached an
agreement with the United University Professions (UUP) to allow for a one-time,
added year of service for all current non-tenured faculty in these academic ranks.
Those faculty wishing to continue within the current track would be allowed to do
so after providing notification to their campus.
A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) has been executed with UUP to
memorialize this change, contingent upon the Board’s approval of these required
regulatory changes.
