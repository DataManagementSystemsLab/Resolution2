183rd Plenary, October 10-12, 2019
System Administration, Albany
183-01-01
For: 41 / Against: 8 / Abstain: 1

RATIONALE:
WHEREAS all SUNY campuses must abide by Research Foundation, funding agenciesâ€™, and
campus-specific policies to investigate allegations of research misconduct; and
WHEREAS if there is suspicion of research misconduct, SUNY should be authorized to
suspend the research activity pending an investigation; and
WHEREAS if after a well-defined investigative procedure is followed in accordance with
federal rules, and research misconduct is proven against a faculty or staff member within the
SUNY system, then the faculty and staff of SUNY are in favor of appropriate sanctions on
those involved; and
WHEREAS in research misconduct cases, the onus of proof is on the institution and the
panels of judges must be absolutely impartial and have no conflicts of interest; and
WHEREAS because a research misconduct policy is one of the few policies that has direct
impact on Academic Rights and Responsibilities, a bedrock principle of SUNY policy, faculty
and staff, through its governing bodies, must be given the opportunity to provide expert
advice and/or modify certain aspects pertaining to the process to ensure impartial, fair, and
transparent mechanisms are provided for handling of such cases to improve confidence that
federal rules are followed; and
WHEREAS problems with entry into and oversight of research misconduct policy can occur
at any SUNY campus; and
WHEREAS the research misconduct policy has been re-written on certain SUNY campuses
without involvement of appropriate governance bodies:

RESOLUTION:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the UFS calls on every SUNY campus to use
appropriate shared governance processes to formulate or update their research misconduct
policy, make it publicly available, and ensure that it is followed; and
1

FURTHER BE IT RESOLVED that the UFS recommends to campus Presidents that the
initial assessment stage of research misconduct investigations on all SUNY campuses be
conducted by a panel of impartial academics, chosen from the local campus, who are free of
conflicts of interest, have appropriate expertise, and understand the issues of legal and
academic freedom at stake. Only after this is done would campus administrative personnel
be involved in administering a federally prescribed investigatory process.
