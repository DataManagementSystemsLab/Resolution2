Resolution on the Conduct of Senate Meetings 

2/27/18



Whereas, the Faculty, Staff, and Students who devote time to the Senate meetings do so on a volunteer basis, and

Whereas, the demands on faculty time are many and varied, and

Whereas, efficient meetings offer the prospect of deeper engagement, therefore



Be it Resolved that,



Reports from Standing Committees of the Senate shall be incorporated as a recurring part of Senate meeting agendas, and shall receive priority in the development of each meeting’s agenda, and



In order to be included on the agenda for a Senate meeting, those responsible for making a report, update, or other presentation shall provide electronic written reports and/or documentation at least one week prior to a meeting of the Faculty Senate, to be distributed to the Senate in a timely manner; absent such prior documentation, reports will not be included in the Agenda, and 



In order to be included on the agenda for discussion at a Senate meeting, reports, updates, or other presentations shall include one or more specific action items to be taken up by the Senate, and



Reports and presentations that are primarily for the purposes of sharing information shall be restricted to brief Q & A periods, rather than for open discussion or “oral presentations” of the written content, and



The Senate shall adopt a general policy of prioritizing new perspectives on an issue under discussion (e.g., limiting “I would like to agree with what was just said...”), as well as new voices in the discussion, and



These rules of conduct may be suspended by a majority vote of the Senate, for special reports or issues of a time-sensitive nature.



Submitted for consideration by Jacob Heller, Sociology Department Senator
