Resolution from the Teacher Education Program
A “Proposed Resolution on the Proposed Teacher Education Graduate Program” was
distributed (attached). Discussion ensued about the accuracy of point 4 of the
resolution, the process in which the proposal for the graduate program may have
been sent inappropriately to SED rather than SUNY, whether there would be an
approval before a site evaluation, and issues that were incomplete in the proposal.
The President noted that we asked for further discussion and advocated the TEP
proposal for approval as of September 2003, but SUNY arrested the process.
A motion was raised to table the resolution to give time for the VP of Academic
Affairs and Chair of TEP to meet and bring the issues back to the Senate. It passed:
Yes

9; No

4; Abstain
