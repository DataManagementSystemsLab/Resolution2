RE: The Faculty University Awards Committee (FUAC) – 2020-2021 Annual Report
During the 2020-2021 academic year, the FUAC completed the following work:
1) We acknowledge the collaborative work of the following committee members (Ali
Ebrahimi, Lorenz S. Neuwirth, Laura Anker, Lisa Whitten, Thomas Lilly, Lorraine
Todisco, Dana Tomlin, Barbara Hillery, Janay Jackson, ) and subcommittee members for
reviewing professional staff files as per SUNY Policies (Ali Ebrahimi, Barbara Hillery,
Betty Barberi, Stacey DeFelice, Gerardo Espinal, Edward Bever, & Lorraine Todisco).
2) The FUAC met 14 times during the 2020-2021 academic year.
3) Reviewed a 7 nomination portfolios to be considered for the SUNY Distinguished Ranks
and the SUNY Chancellor’s Awards in Excellence: Distinguished Professor (1),
Distinguished Service Professor (1), Excellence in Teaching (3), Excellence in Scholarship
And Creative Activities (1), Excellence in Professional Service (1).There were no
nominations for the Adjunct Excellence in Teaching, Excellence in Librarianship, nor the
Shared Governance Awards. Of these 7 nomination portfolios, 1 Distinguished Service
Professor, 2 Excellence in Teaching, 1 Excellence in Scholarship And Creative Activities,
and 1 in Excellence in Professional Service were supported and sent forth to the College
administration for deliberation and submission to SUNY-level administrators. Of these 5
nominee’s portfolios that were put forward by the FUAC, all were submitted to SUNYlevel administration and were awarded.
4) The FUAC developed early and late semester notification systems of the award timelines
for the College to increase awareness, transparency, and knowledge of the deadlines for
submitting nomination portfolios. In addition, the transparent communication regarding
the confidentiality of the nomination portfolios was made clear that once a nominee’s
portfolio is submitted, they will hear back from either SUNY if awarded (i.e., later Spring
of each year). If they were not awarded, they would receive constructive feedback from the
FUAC (i.e., after the official SUNY awardee announcements have been made) to support
their efforts in a subsequent re-submission if they so choose.
5) The FUAC adopted the Interfolio system for the submission of nominee’s portfolios similar
to the procedures of the Academic, Reappointment, Promotion and Tenure (ARPT)
Committee. This will continue to be the way that nomination portfolios are submitted
moving forward.
6) The FUAC developed new internal processes and procedures for reviewing, internally
scoring (i.e., for the FUAC use only), and deliberating on all nomination portfolios. These
processes and procedures were developed to best align with the SUNY-system evaluation

1

criteria to make the review and deliberation of nominee’s more streamlined, as well as,
increasing a complete package for SUNY-level administrative deliberations on each
nominee that is put forward by the College President/Officer-in-Charge.
7) The FUAC also increased its communication with SUNY-level administration to debunk
any myths, misconceptions, and ensure accuracy of statements regarding eligibility criteria
for the campus community members to be made aware of if they decide to put a nomination
portfolio together. For example, faculty at the rank of Full Professor are eligible to be
nominated for the Chancellor’s Awards for Excellence. There was a prior misconception,
that if faculty reach the rank of Full Professor that they are ineligible to be nominated.
8) In consultation with SUNY-level administration, all historical and chronological records
of past Chancellor’s Awards for Excellence and Distinguish Ranks were researched and
corrected. The FUAC found many errors in the awards of past recipients and some
awardees were not reflected in the SUNY-level records. These records were corrected,
archived in the FUAC, and submitted to the College President to forward to the SUNYlevel administration for clerical correction, updating, and archiving. Thus, from 19652021, all awardee records are now accurate and these recorded match between SUNY-OW
and the SUNY-level administration.
9) The FUAC worked to increase more equity, inclusion, and diversity of its membership with
respect to its roles in evaluating a wide-range of nominees to provide a more broad and fair
review of all nominee’s portfolios.
10) Consistent with the last point, the FUAC updated its By-laws and has sent their revisions
to the By-laws Committee for consultation, review, and feedback. It is anticipated that in
the Fall 21 semester, the By-laws Committee will then hold two town halls to solicit faculty
input and feedback to these revisions, prior to the final draft of the FUAC By-laws being
sent to the Faculty Senate for introduction, review, discussion, and subsequent voting.
11) The FUAC also consulted with the Faculty Senate Chair and administration to develop
more avenues for highlighting faculty that earn these awards such as but not limited to: a
College webpage dedicated to all the awardees along with photos and short bios, pictures
and short bios displayed on campus through picture frames or digital media TV slideshow
advertisements, potential financial compensation if/when funds permit or to develop a
dedicated funding source for establishing and sustaining such an incentive, etc.).
The FUAC annual report evidences a large amount of work that the committee had undertaken
during the 2020-2021 academic year in a collegial and transparent effort to support the faculty and
staff of SUNY-OW to be recognized for all the important work that they do in raising the profile
of the College.
Respectfully,

Dr. Alireza Ebrahimi
