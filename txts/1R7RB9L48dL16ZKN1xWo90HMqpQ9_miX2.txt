Dear Judith:
Thank you for your letter informing UUP of the SUNY Old Westbury Faculty Senate’s
endorsement of UUP’s resolution regarding Candace de Russy’s comments in the
February 4 Newsday article. I am sure you have seen subsequent press on this issue,
and our position continues to be that Candace de Russy can say whatever she pleases,
however ill advised, as an individual.

Her position as a Trustee, however, carries with it

the responsibility of carrying out SUNY’s mission and not her own.
Please thank the Faculty Senate for their support.
Sincerely

yours,

LIEe
