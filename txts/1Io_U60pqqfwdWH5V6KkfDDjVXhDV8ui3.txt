Resolution on
System-Wide Assessment

Whereas the University Faculty Senate has passed 3 resolutions opposing university-wide

assessment, and

Whereas a resolution on university-wide assessment was submitted to the SUNY Board

of Trustees despite assurances from the chancellor that no such resolution would be
considered until a joint administration/faculty task force on university-wide assessment
had completed its work, and

Whereas this resolution was voted on and passed by the SUNY Board of Trustees despite

the fact that the task force was engaged in productive negotiations not yet completed, and

Whereas faculty representatives present at this Board of Trustees meeting were denied
the right to speak despite their request to do so, and
Whereas faculty input nevertheless remains crucial to any assessment process carried out

by SUNY,

Be it affirmed that
1.

the Faculty Senate of the State University of New York College at Plattsburgh

rejects the resolution passed by the SUNY Board of trustees on June 15

unilaterally imposing upon the University and its constituent campuses universitywide assessment of student foundational learning outcomes, and
2.

the Faculty Senate of the State University of New York College at Plattsburgh
supports the effort of SUNY Faculty Governance to arrive at a Memorandum of
Understanding with System Administration regarding the implementation of

university-wide assessment of student foundational learning outcomes should
System Administration proceed with such assessment despite its rejection by
SUNY faculty.
