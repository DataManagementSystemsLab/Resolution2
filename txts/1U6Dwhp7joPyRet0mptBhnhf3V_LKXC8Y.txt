Resolution for Simplification of Transfer Residency Requirements

            Submitted by the Academic Practices Committee, 5/8/16

Whereas, the College currently has dual requirements for transfer student
residency, one consisting of a credit count, the other of a semester count,
and

Whereas, the stated credit count could be achieved in fewer semesters than
currently required and in exceptional cases has been, with waivers granted
by the APC, and

Whereas, the semester requirement places unnecessary burdens on highly
motivated students who could potentially complete their studies sooner, and


Whereas, few peer institutions have such dual requirements for transfer
student residency, the vast majority having only credit requirements,

Be It Resolved, that we eliminate the semester requirement for transfer
residency while upholding the current 40 (or 48 for Accounting) credit
requirement by amending the relevant Catalogue language as follows:

Residency Requirement

To earn a degree from SUNY College at Old Westbury, students are required
to earn a minimum of 40* credits at Old Westbury. fulfill the residency
requirement. This requirement can be fulfilled by completing one of the
following:

1) A student must earn a minimum of 40* credits at Old Westbury and attend
Old Westbury for at least 3 academic semesters (spring or fall) on a full-
time or part-time basis;

      OR

2) A student must earn a minimum of 40* credits at Old Westbury and attend
Old Westbury for at least 2 academic semesters (spring or fall) and
