Resolution on Salary Compression/Inversion
submitted by Jacob Heller, FRRC Chair (Sociology Department)
read into the minutes on 9/11/15



Whereas, over a life-long career, full-time tenure-stream salaries are typically constrained by the economic climate at the moment of initial hire, and

Whereas, recent UUP contracts have not contained DSI provisions that accrue to base salaries (and which could therefore be used to address salary inequities over the career of a faculty member), but only “lump sum” DSI payments, and

Whereas, there currently exists not only inequity, but also serious salary compression and even salary inversion at all ranks of the tenure-stream faculty, and

Whereas, salary inequity weakens morale, and – if unaddressed – can create a corrosive atmosphere that inhibits the achievement of the College’s mission, and

Whereas, the College administration and the faculty are in agreement that salary inequity, especially salary compression and inversion, should be addressed, and

Whereas, a set of criteria and a process for the alleviation of salary inequity, especially salary compression and inversion, that has been developed in collaboration between faculty and staff will bind the faculty to said criteria and process, therefore, 

Be it Resolved: that a Joint Task Force on Salary Inequity be empanelled by the Provost and the Senate Chair, with equal numbers of appointees by each, and for that group to elect from its ranks a member to serve as the Task Force’s Chair and spokesperson, and, be it further

Resolved, that the Joint Task Force on Salary Inequity report its recommendations for the criteria for equity salary adjustments, with a calendar for their implementation within 3 months of its creation, and, be it further

Resolved, that members of the Joint Task Force on Salary Inequity be eligible for inclusion in the salary equity adjustment, based on the objective criteria established by the Joint Task Force on Salary Inequity.
