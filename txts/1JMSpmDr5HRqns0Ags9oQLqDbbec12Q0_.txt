Faculty Culture Resolution (revised)
RESOLUTION OF THE FACULTY SENATE
reaffirming A Faculty Culture for Shared Governance
Whereas, the mission of SUNY, “…to provide to the people of New York educational services of the
highest quality, with the broadest possible access, fully representative of all segments of the population in
a complete range of academic, professional and vocational postsecondary programs including such
additional activities in pursuit of these objectives as are necessary or customary,” is vested in the Faculty,
and,
Whereas, Article X, §4 of the Policies of the SUNY Board of Trustees states that, “The faculty of each
college shall have the obligation to participate significantly in the initiation, development and
implementation of the educational program,” and,
Whereas, Article X §5 (a)1-3 of the Policies of the SUNY Board of Trustees states that, “(a) The faculty
of each college shall prepare and adopt bylaws which shall contain: (1) Provisions for committees and
their responsibilities; (2) Procedures for the calling and conduct of faculty meetings and elections; and (3)
Provisions for such other matters of organization and procedure as may be necessary for the performance
of their responsibilities,” and,
Whereas, the SUNY College at Old Westbury has established such organizational rules and expectations
by which the Faculty both affirm and exercise these responsibilities (the Faculty Bylaws (viz. Article II)),
for the purpose of meeting the College’s mission as a local institution of SUNY, and,
Whereas, the voting Faculty of SUNY College at Old Westbury have approved and accepted the
provisions of our Faculty Bylaws, and
Whereas, SUNY College at Old Westbury has made a lifetime commitment to its tenured faculty, by
virtue of their demonstrated commitment to the mission of the College, and specifically to teaching,
service and scholarship in support of that mission,
Therefore, be it Resolved, That the faculty at the College shall dedicate their efforts to the support of the
mission of the College, through conformance and compliance with the Faculty Bylaws, which describe
the established systems and processes for advancing that mission, and
Resolved, That the faculty at the College – especially the TENURED faculty at the college – shall,
through their expertise, experience, mentorship and by shouldering an equitable share of the burdens of
those responsibilities, specifically model and instantiate behaviors that support and strengthen faculty
governance as (1) the means for achieving goals within the academy and as (2) the structure by which
such change is wrought; and
Resolved, That the faculty at the College shall make every good faith effort to operate in the best interest
of the campus community, and avoid willful or inadvertent circumvention of approved and sanctioned
“systems and processes” of faculty governance (e.g., the Faculty Senate and the committees under its
auspices), in which the Faculty and the College have vested such authority; and
Furthermore be it Resolved, That the Faculty strengthen and support the established committees of the
Senate and its Executive Committee through their sincere and productive use of said committees,
according to their purview, to assist and address such disseminations, issues, activities, concerns and
grievances related to the development of Faculty and their responsibilities and relations within the campus
community, and the College’s mission, under the Faculty Bylaws.
Respectfully submitted by the Executive Committee, 12/6/13
