Resolutions on Changes to College Policy on Probation, Suspension and Dismissal
Resolution 1: Policy regarding student participation in clubs, committees, and intercollegiate
athletics
Whereas academic probation is intended as a support measure designed to encourage students
to focus on their studies in order that they may satisfy academic standards; and
Whereas involvement in extracurricular college activities, such as clubs, committees, and
athletics often helps maintain students’ engagement with the institution, and may thus help
maintain their commitment to meeting academic standards; and
Whereas barring students who have maintained a cumulative GPA of 2.00 or higher from
participating in such extracurricular activities is unnecessarily punitive, and may undermine
their connection to the institution;
Be it resolved that a student whose GPA for one semester is below 2.00, but maintains a
cumulative GPA of 2.00 or higher may still participate in student clubs, committees, and
intercollegiate athletics.
Resolution 2: Policy regarding reinstatement procedure
Whereas students have two choices in how to respond to a suspension or dismissal: observe
the time periods in which they must sit out the semester (one semester for suspension, two
semesters for dismissal), or appeal the decision and attend a hearing with the Academic
Standing Committee; and
Whereas current procedure, as currently written in the college policy, requires the registrar to
contact the members of the Academic Policies and Practices Committee (APPC) to get
permission for a student who observed the time period suspension or dismissal to be
reinstated; and
Whereas this procedure unnecessarily delays the registration of students returning from
suspension or dismissal;
Be it resolved that the registrar no longer needs to have permission from APPC to reinstate a
student who chose not to appeal the initial Dean’s Office decision, and who observed their
suspension or dismissal.
