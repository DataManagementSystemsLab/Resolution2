Provost’s Report
• Commencement is on Sunday at Nassau Coliseum. Parking nearby is available before 8am,
or a shuttle bus is available from NCC. It will start promptly at 9am. Direct any questions
to Pat Smith.

VI.

University Senator Report (Laurette Morris)
• Please see attached handout.
• Are we a participating in the Re-Enroll To Complete initiative? Informally we did this, but
not as part of a SUNY initiative.
• Many campuses are strained due to increased enrollment. We are in better shape than
most. Maybe more students are motivated to move here. There are both recruitment
attempts by SUNY system and rising demographics. Some campuses were not prepared.
The system administration is regularly addressing problems.
• Is there any mechanism for transfer students to be no longer counted as attrition? There is
no adjustment right now. When the EC met with Chancellor Johnson she agreed that we
need new metrics. The Provost reports that at a cabinet meeting we discussed this with
Chancellor Johnson further.
• Cross registration between campuses is possible. We need to advise students about this.

VII.

Faculty Senate Chair Nomination & Election

IX.

In response to questions from the floor at April 27 FS meeting, a Supplement has been
included with the resolution with references for energy and sustainability policies in
SUNY and NYS, a sampling of best practices in campus sustainability, and information
on carbon emissions and carbon offset. A phrase was added to connect it to the
Strategic Plan. We have an important designation as a tree campus. This is at odds
with the parking lot construction. There needs to be some way to compensate for the
carbon footprint impact.
The eighth Whereas of the resolution cites Article X of the BOT Policies, but Article X is
specific to faculty authority regarding the educational program. Our Bylaws describe
the authority of the faculty to review and oversee administrative policies and decisions,
consistent with SUNY governance practices. Move to remove the reference to Article X.
Expand the “consistent with practices” part to also say board of trustees and system
administration. It is better to cite senate resolution or joint effort.
The first resolved is moot because the trees have already been cut down. Perhaps we
can use Google maps to look at the aerial view. Not all of the trees are gone, just some.
Tree removal was previously stated as over 8 acres as part of Phase II.
Senate chair would deliver to the President later after the resolution is passed.
Designated parking for faculty could be part of a later resolution.
Are there requirements for being designated as a tree campus? We should look into
specifics and whether or not there is an arborist who comes and checks.
Beyond the policies and principles stated in resolution, perhaps tabling the resolution
and looking into specific requirements for Tree Campus designation may give the
resolution more teeth. This is seconded since it is better to say we want to comply with
specific certification.
Who is going to make this happen? There is going to be a Green Committee.
Suggest that after the third Whereas another Whereas be added that says it is a charge
to the Green Committee.
Motion to table is seconded. The bylaws may permit this since it says, “by electronic
means”. In a previous chair report, it is noted a number of things were voted on
electronically. The motion is tabled unanimously by voice vote (0 abstain, 0 object).
OER Resolution
In the second resolved, 4th bullet: we will hopefully have more than one instructional
designer. Change to “a” not “the”.
At the bottom “all member” should have an “s”.
Passed by hand vote: 21 in-favor, 0 abstain, 0 opposed.

Call to Senators: Other New Business
A.

CAP Resolution for Economics Minor (Frank Sanacory)
•

There are no real additional resources here. It is part of the puzzle to later create a
major in Economics. It would be great to vote over the summer electronically.
Frank Sanacory will be on sabbatical past Jun 15. It might be included in the new
catalog if it is approved asap. Senators should have an ability to go back to their
departments. Perhaps one week. We can email this to all faculty, and direct faculty
to direct their comments to their senator. Vote will be due by next Wednesday. The
email will be sent today. There will be a google poll.

Update as of 5/25/18 - electronic voting was conducted: 19 in favor, 0 abstain, 0

University Faculty Senator’s Report: Spring Plenary Session (U Buffalo)
1. SUNY Financial Strain/Campus Closings?
This question of whether there were plans to close any SUNY campuses was posed to Gwen
Kay, UFS President (as it has been at both of the sessions I attended this year). Her response
was more definitive this spring:
•
•
•

No, not in the near future anyway, because campuses are economic drivers for their
community.
State senators are motivated to not let their particular campus close, and will presumably
fight to keep their campus open.
However, two-thirds of the SUNY campuses are “financially strained”;

Other financial circumstances:
•
•
•

FTE enrollment is down in many of the upstate campuses, both CC’s and the
comprehensive colleges;
Some upstate private schools are also in financial trouble;
At comprehensive colleges sector meeting, various strategies being employed by various
comp colleges included:
o increasing class enrollments
o decreasing evening classes
o decreasing the number of adjuncts
o investing in higher paying students (e.g. graduate programs)
o SUNY Brockport ! budget and planning committee, consisting of
administration, faculty and staff that met and brainstormed for over a year on how
they could cut costs without retrenching full-time faculty…
o some campuses (e.g. New Paltz, U Buffalo) are financing their own new
buildings/facilities via partnerships (e.g. U Buffalo ! Drs. took out mortgage for
their new medical training facility, and then partnered with private agencies, etc.
to gain the financial support – cf. sports world where corporate sponsor pays for
the new stadium, perhaps with some public tax relief, then has the new facility
named after the corporate sponsor.)
o SUNY Potsdam – now resorting to taking loan $ as a source of funding!

Impact of Excelsior:
o Fall 2017 ! ap. 17,000 SUNY students received Excelsior Scholarships
o ! decrease in students (esp. FTEs) in the CCs, some comprehensive colleges
(e.g. SUNY Oneonta),
o ! decrease in FTEs in private colleges as well;
o However, students who receive TAP or PELL grants are not eligible for Excelsior
! decreases the percentage of Excelsior-eligible students on SUNY campuses

1

"
"
•

AY2016-2017: 104,480 SUNY students were offered a TAP grant; 42% of
all matriculated undergraduates received a federal loan;
Fall 2017: 130,997 SUNY students received PELL grants, and

Some concern expressed that the Chancellor will advocate for privatizing SUNY (or at
least some campuses), but that option was not mentioned at the Plenary.

2. Chancellor Johnson’s Visit and Q & A (via Zoom Conference)
•
•

has been visiting SUNY campuses (just recently visited OW) – where she meets with the
President, President’s team, faculty governance leadership, faculty and students;
had major health scare the previous week (prior to Spring plenary) ! has had some impact
on her priorities, although her overall vision consisting of four themes remains:
o
o
o
o

•

energy and sustainability
innovation/entrepreneurship/research
“individualized education” initiative (see below)
partnerships – key to bringing more resources to SUNY
# Cultivating partnerships with private corporations, philanthropic partners,
and other sources
# (e.g. working on strategic plan with NYPA / partnership with National
Grid regarding utilities…”stay tuned”)

Chancellor’s more recent concerns/additional priorities:
o
o
o
o

safety of students, faculty and staff – from active shooters and sexual assaults;
seamless transfer
more full-time faculty
stability and respect for our university system

3. Individualized Education – Update (Interim Provost Grace Wang)
•
•

An update on this theme of the Chancellor’s vision;
Rationale and Goals:
o allows students the flexibility and capability to learn on their terms;
o helps students with different backgrounds and different resources to succeed;
# Micro-Credentialing
[SEE: (1)Memorandum to Members of the Board of Trustees from
Chancellor Kristina Johnson re: SUNY Micro-Credentialing
Implementation (dated 1/23/18) with attached Excerpt from and
Highlights and Notes: Report of the SUNY Micro-Credentialing Task;
(2) Memorandum from Interim Provost and Vice Chancellor for Research
and Economic Development Grace Wang on Final Report of the MicroCredentialing Task Force (dated 2/7/18); and (3) Ed Bever’s Presentation
to OW Faculty at Full Faculty Meeting (May 11, 2018)]

# Academic Advising – more facilitative to student success;
→ Degree Works ! Individual Academic Plan (utilizing single,
interactive software) – allows students to determine their progress
towards degree completion, and what they need to complete their
degree requirements;)
→ NOTE: Degree Works is intended to interact with academic advising
(from humans)/ supplement not replace it!
→ Degree Works Usage data 2017:
43 campuses
230K users
3.9 million logins
→ SUNY ! SUNY Transfers
nearly 60,000 students transfer across the SUNY System each
academic year; (Majority: 60% - 2 ! 4-year campus)
Degree Works – Transfer Finder ! allows students to
compare Individualized Academic Transfer Plans by
comparing degree progress if students were to transfer to one
SUNY campus vs. another SUNY campus (Academic History
! Search for Programs ! Compare Individualized Academic
Transfer Plans).
# Cross-Registration ! allows students from one SUNY campus to take a
course at another SUNY campus;
provides course availability;
decreases time to degree completion;
! streamline, standardize, and automate process of crossregistration:
" new cross registration electronic platform replaced
paper-based process;
" implementation: 52 campuses participating.
# Re-Enroll to Complete ! encourages students who withdrew before
degree completion to return to school and finish credential/degree
requirements:
students who have dropped are contacted, provided
information (including data on employment earnings)
intended to motivate them to return to school;
currently: in a two-year pilot project with multiple
campuses; 1185 students contacted;
message themes to students included:
" financial benefits associated with degree completion
(Associate – Bachelor’s – Advanced degrees);
" “Come back to SUNY”;
" academic program counseling available;
3

" free financial aid literacy and financial aid resources.
" ! over 80% contacted re-enrolled at SUNY (N<1000)
Next Step !Scale up of Re-Enroll to Complete program
(launched on March 14, 2018)
" $1M investment;
" 29 participating campuses;
" 3,184 withdrawn students already receiving target
outreach (as of March 2018).
Issues of Concern:
•

•

Nina Tamrowski, FCCC President: Individualized education plans (aka: guided
pathways)! may result in streamlining that decreases course offerings at the community
college level;
Anastasia Pratt, Empire State College: There are financial aid restrictions to students
doing micro-credentialing ! a “policy problem” according to Interim Provost Wang that
should be addressed.

4. Applied Learning Degree Requirements by Campus
•

•
•

UFS Undergraduate Academic Programs and Policies Committee ! Report presenting
compiled data (including survey responses) re: applied learning as a graduation
requirement for individual SUNY campuses, and degree of shared governance
involvement in the policy decision whether or not to require AL for graduation.
Seven of the 27 (26%) of the campuses included in the report have an applied learning
graduation requirement.
SEE: Applied Learning Degree Requirements by Campus Report (dated April, 2018).

7. Open Educational Resources (OER) Update
•
•
•
•

report by Mark McBride, Library Senior Strategist at Library and Information Services
SUNY Administration;
Open NYS = collaboration between SUNY and CUNY showcasing and supporting the
use of sharing of open educational resources (OER);
Numerous workshops as part of education campaign: 12 in Fall 2017; 14 in Spring 2018;
65,817 SUNY students enrolled to take an OER course in AY 2017-2018;
o Estimated textbook savings = ap.$7,460,733.00 (based on national averages);
o Top five disciplines utilizing/benefitting from OER (based on enrollments) thus far:
" math
" English
" first year experience
" business
" psychology
o OF NOTE: October 10-12, 2018 ! an international Open Education Conference
to be held in NYS. Among the members of the conference planning committee is
4

SUNY Student Assembly member Evan Rufrano (OW), who is forming a
student panel to present at the conference.
Issues of Concern:
•
•
•
•
•

Use of OER materials/texts may be questioned by transfer and post-graduate institutions,
compared to the validity of established texts);
Maintaining ownership of original material/work (e.g. Creative Common license);
More information needed on best practices for use of OER ! stay tuned, survey data to
come;
Problem of texts online via OER having different pagination compared to original texts;
Can OER encourage students to go ! library and actually read real books?!
o McBride noted that students actually do want both options, that is, digital and
print materials;
o OER is still working on this…

6. Resolutions
