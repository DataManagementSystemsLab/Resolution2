GEC Resolution on LEAP “Essential Learning Outcomes”



Whereas Old Westbury is an accredited member institution of the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (“Middle States”), and;

Whereas, in its recent “Standards of Accreditation and Requirements of Affiliation” (2014), Middle States placed greater emphasis on institutional objectives (also known as “college-wide objectives”), and;

Whereas, Middle States specifically emphasizes that those should relate to the institution’s Mission, and;

Whereas, increasingly, Middle States expects member institutions to apply findings from ongoing assessment of curricular effectiveness to future planning, and; 

Whereas, since its introduction in 2006, the American Association of Colleges and University’s “LEAP” (Liberal Education and America’s Promise) program has become a national standard in liberal higher education, and;

Whereas, the four LEAP “Essential Learning Outcomes” are:

Knowledge of Human Cultures and the Physical and Natural World;

Intellectual and Practical Skills

Personal and Social Responsibility

Integrative and Applied Learning

And, whereas, Old Westbury’s Mission and Guiding Principles strengthen LEAP’s Essential Learning Outcomes by adding a “commitment to a more just and sustainable world,”







Be it resolved that the Faculty Senate adopt the LEAP Essential Learning Outcomes and the College’s Mission and Guiding Principles as its model for the creation of institutional (or college-wide) learning outcomes, and;



Be it further resolved that the Senate create a joint faculty-administrative body to begin the process of developing workshops with a goal of “mapping” our curriculum onto the LEAP institutional outcomes.









Approved by the General Education Committee, March 11, 2016







LEAP’s Essential Learning Outcomes

The LEAP campaign is organized around a robust set of "Essential Learning Outcomes" -- all of which are best developed by a contemporary liberal education. Described in College Learning for the New Global Century, these essential learning outcomes and a set of "Principles of Excellence" provide a new framework to guide students' cumulative progress through college.

Through its VALUE Initiative, AAC&U has developed a set of rubrics to assess many of the following learning outcomes. Beginning in school, and continuing at successively higher levels across their college studies, students should prepare for twenty-first-century challenges by gaining:

Knowledge of Human Cultures and the Physical and Natural World

		Through study in the sciences and mathematics, social sciences, humanities, histories, languages, and the arts

Focused by engagement with big questions, both contemporary and enduring

Intellectual and Practical Skills, Including

		Inquiry and analysis

Critical and creative thinking

Written and oral communication

Quantitative literacy

Information literacy

Teamwork and problem solving

Practiced extensively, across the curriculum, in the context of progressively more challenging problems, projects, and standards for performance

Personal and Social Responsibility, Including

		Civic knowledge and engagement—local and global

Intercultural knowledge and competence

Ethical reasoning and action

Foundations and skills for lifelong learning

Anchored through active involvement with diverse communities and real-world challenges

Integrative and Applied Learning, Including

		Synthesis and advanced accomplishment across general and specialized studies

Demonstrated through the application of knowledge, skills, and responsibilities to new settings and complex problems

Liberal Education.  Old Westbury promotes rigorous intellectual inquiry, grounded in ethical and civic values, that connects learning in the classroom with engagement in the community. Through an integrative curriculum, innovative pedagogy, and small classes we provide a transformative educational experience that fosters the capacity for life-long intellectual and personal growth.

Participatory Governance.  To exemplify in all College policies the values we espouse, Old Westbury upholds the principles of transparency, accountability and democracy in every aspect of governance and planning conducted by students, staff, faculty, administration, trustees and friends of the College alike.

Intercultural Understanding.  Old Westbury promotes an inclusive environment and critical awareness of the multiplicity and range of human perspectives and identities (including race, ethnicity, religion, gender, class, sexuality, age, and (dis)ability, among others) through the interactions of students, faculty and staff within its diverse learning community.

Sustainability.  The campus community is dedicated to the stewardship of our environment and fragile ecosystem and to equity in the allocation and preservation of shared resources—such as air, water, and land—on campus, on Long Island, and in the larger world.

Social Justice.  Old Westbury promotes social justice and equality in living and learning through its historic commitment to educational empowerment, diversity, access, equity, self-determination, community activism and responsible global citizenship.
