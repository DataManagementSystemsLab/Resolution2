contract with Elsevier
DATE:
183rd Plenary, October 10-12, 2019
LOCATION:
System Administration, Albany
RESOLUTION #: 183-04-01
VOTE TALLY:
For: 47 / Against: 2 / Abstain: 2

RATIONALE:
WHEREAS SUNY has been a subscriber to Elsevier’s Science Direct pursuant to a contract
that expires on December 31, 2019; and
WHEREAS this contract has allowed the SUNY community to have access to a large array of
high-quality materials that are indispensable to learning, teaching, and research; and
WHEREAS SUNY paid over $9 million for access to Science Direct last year, with the total
cost to the SUNY System over the life of the contract being nearly $45 million, and payments
to Elsevier make up 25% of SUNY’s overall expenditures on journals; and
WHEREAS SUNY, through the SUNY Libraries Consortium (SLC), has been negotiating the
terms of a new contract with Elsevier, but has been unsuccessful to date in negotiating a new
contract; and
WHEREAS the University of California (UC) system sought to negotiate a contract with
Elsevier for access to Science Direct offerings, such negotiations met an impasse, and the
contract lapsed after UC had paid Elsevier more than $11 million annually; and
WHEREAS universities across Europe, in countries such as Germany, Sweden, and Norway,
have cancelled subscriptions with Elsevier after failed negotiations; and
WHEREAS Elsevier, in addition to deriving revenue from SUNY and other parties through
subscriptions, also requires faculty authors to pay article publication charges (APCs) for
publication in Elsevier journals; and
WHEREAS Elsevier has, in effect, gained a monopoly over the publication of and access to
high-quality peer reviewed outlets; and
WHEREAS Elsevier has failed to expeditiously engage in the SUNY Science Direct contract
negotiation process and, if the contract is not extended, the SUNY community will no longer
have unlimited access to Elsevier’s collection; and

WHEREAS SUNY negotiators are extremely concerned that the failure to resolve the
contract negotiation impasse with Elsevier will lead to the same situation as occurred with the
UC System and the European universities, namely, that the contract will lapse on December
31, 2019:

RESOLUTION:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the University Faculty Senate (UFS) calls upon
Elsevier to negotiate earnestly and in good faith with SUNY to reach a fair and reasonable
agreement on a new contract; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that UFS expresses its complete solidarity and stands united
with the SUNY negotiators in their negotiations with Elsevier, additionally requesting that all
Senators advocate for support of this resolution from their campus governance bodies; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that UFS believes a fair and reasonable Science Direct
contract with Elsevier should be negotiated and requests the Chancellor direct the SUNY
negotiators to pursue the goals of reducing SUNY expenditures, maintaining access to the
current holdings, and supporting open access publishing; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that UFS requests affirmation from campus governance
bodies in supporting SUNY taking a strong stance in negotiations with Elsevier because it will
have the salutary effect of engendering meaningful change in the way faculty research is
bought, sold, and shared with the world, thereby better compensating faculty for their hard
work and effort; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that UFS recommends and requests that if Elsevier does not
negotiate a contract that is deemed fair and reasonable by SUNY negotiators, the Chancellor
direct the SUNY negotiators to follow the lead of UC and the aforementioned European
universities and not enter into a new contract with Elsevier, and instead pursue alternative
means with campus presidents to access scholarly works that are critical to the learning,
teaching, and research of the SUNY community; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that UFS recommends and requests that if the SUNY
negotiators decline to enter into a new contract with Elsevier, the Chancellor will ask Chief
Administrative Officers at all campuses and the Provost will direct SUNY System
Administration to follow the lead of the UC Provost and President by protecting the funds that
would otherwise be allocated towards Elsevier with the intention that those funds be
reallocated for alternative access to scholarly works and to subsidize APCs in open access
peer-reviewed journals; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that UFS requests all Senators and campus governance
bodies raise the issue of SUNY-Elsevier negotiations at the local level, support campus
contingency planning in the event of non-renewal, and prepare their own resolutions to
demonstrate unity with the SUNY negotiators at the local campus level, thus strengthening
SUNY’s negotiating position.
