MEMORANDUM
March 22, 2018
TO:

Members of the Board of Trustees

FROM:

Kristina M. Johnson, Chancellor

SUBJECT:

Campus Open Access Policies and System Repository

Action Requested
The proposed resolution directs the development of campus-specific open
access policies for faculty, student, and staff scholarship and creative works and the
creation of searchable repositories.
Resolution
I recommend that the Board of Trustees adopt the following resolution:
Whereas State University of New York faculty, students and
staff routinely produce scholarly and creative works that are
of public interest, inform the works of other scholars, and
promote scholarly activities in their respective fields; and
Whereas the scholarly and creative works of SUNY faculty,
students and staff are frequently published in leading journals,
many of which have open access provisions; and
Whereas the dissemination and sharing of published
scholarship and creative works is the cornerstone of
communication among scholars; and
Whereas a significant proportion of SUNY research and
scholarship is supported by either direct federal agency grants
or federal funding channeled through state agencies; and
Whereas many federal agencies are instituting requirements
about public accessibility to the final work product of efforts
they fund; and
Whereas access to scholarly journals has become
increasingly cost-prohibitive for SUNY faculty, staff and
students, and for the libraries that support them, and
awareness of journal open access provisions and/or
opportunities for shared resources which would increase
access can be improved; and

Whereas best practices in the development of open access
policies include:


respect for and protection of faculty, student and staff
ownership,
and
the
empowerment
of
these
scholars/creators to voluntarily make informed
determinations about whether and where to share their
scholarly and creative work;



information resources and training relative to faculty,
student and staff ownership, including processes for the
return of rights under open access provisions of certain
scholarly journals;



flexibility for scholars/creators in choosing the terms of
use and licensing associated with each article/work that
they elect to include in an open access repository, such
as whether it can be used for commercial or noncommercial use, copied, edited, remixed and built upon;



cataloguing of materials included in the open access
repository, facilitating user recognition of types of
information housed;



issuance of an addendum for each article/work that
authors can provide to publishers notifying them of the
open access policy; and

Whereas several SUNY campuses and many other institutions
of higher education have developed optional repositories for
faculty to archive and make available their published scholarship
and creative works; and
Whereas the Office of the System Provost currently maintains
an optional repository for campuses to utilize that could be
expanded; now, therefore, be it
Resolved that SUNY continues to encourage faculty, students
and staff to pursue publication of their scholarly/creative works
in peer-reviewed journals, monographs, proceedings, books,
etc.—its commitment to open access is not meant to supplant
those efforts but to increase access to them; and, be it further
Resolved that each State-operated campus shall develop and
adopt—via a consultative process that follows local faculty
governance procedures and includes the faculty, student and
staff protections and best practices identified in this resolution—
an open access policy that recognizes each campus’s unique
mission and culture by no later than March 31, 2020; and, be it
further

Resolved that each community college is also encouraged to
develop and adopt—via a consultative process that follows local
faculty governance procedures and includes the faculty, student
and staff protections and best practices identified in this
resolution—an open access policy; and, be it further
Resolved that the System Provost shall work with campus chief
academic officers, SUNY librarians, and other appropriate
campus and System Administration staff to ensure that every
SUNY faculty member and student has access to an openaccess scholarly repository, and, where appropriate, related
shared/networked services, and that these SUNY repositories
be integrated and searchable via a single interface; and, be it
further
Resolved that each campus open access policy shall be
consistent with the rights and responsibilities set forth in the
Board of Trustees Policies, Article XI, Title J: Patents, Inventions
and Copyright Policy, as codified in Sections 335.28 and 335.29
of Title 8 of the Official Compilation of Codes, Rules, and
Regulations of the State of New York; and, be it further
Resolved the Chancellor and System Provost shall work with
campus leadership, faculty, students and other key stakeholders
to implement this resolution, including the continued consultation
with faculty and student governance and the provision of
informational resources and training about ownership rights and
responsibilities, and shall report periodically to the Board of
Trustees on progress and about any additional steps that may
be needed to ensure the successful implementation of this
resolution.
Background
This resolution is designed to advance access to the scholarly and creative
works of SUNY faculty, students and staff via open access repositories. Open
Access is defined as typically free, timely, online availability of scholarly and creative
works that permit users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to
the full texts of articles for any lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical
barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the Internet.
Recognizing that faculty priorities regarding scholarship vary by individual,
discipline, and institution, this resolution calls for the collaborative development of
campus policies that respect ownership as delineated above and incorporate best
practices as outlined herein.
This resolution was informed by actions of the SUNY University Faculty
Senate on open access and a System-wide Open Access Taskforce.
