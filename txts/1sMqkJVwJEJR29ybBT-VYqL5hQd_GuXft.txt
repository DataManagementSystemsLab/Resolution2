CAP Committee Resolution on the Honors Program
Whereas:
Students, faculty and staff have historically expressed an interest in the development of an honors program
at Old Westbury,
And whereas:
The double objectives of new, but still inclusive, admission policies and the enlargement of the General
Education program suggest that the college is now capable of embarking on an interdisciplinary Honors
Program, which would put Old Westbury in line with other colleges in CUNY, SUNY and nationwide pursuing
the task of making their Honors curricula more visible, creative and devoted to the pursuit of academic
distinction,

And whereas:
At Old Westbury the mission of the Honors Program will contribute to the mission of Old Westbury in at least
three ways: (1) it will enhance the quality of integrative interdisciplinary education by allowing for an in-depth
rapport between students and faculty; (2) by combining community service with academic leaning, the
Honors Program will further the idea of students as active citizens, also a long term objective of Old
Westbury; and (3) it will contribute to higher retention rates and the overall prestige of the College, since
studies show that Honors Programs always have a higher retention rate than the university's and attract a
higher visibility in the student community as well as among funders,
And whereas:
The Honors Program will create a community of learners, in small classes, seminars and research projects
that enable them to have freedom and responsibility for their education; involve them in community service
which also gives students a greater role in both their education and community work; and cap this integrative
process through an Honors Thesis drawing on both academic and community work,
And whereas:
A sub-committee of CAP has prepared a draft proposal that will be further refined based on input from the
Campus Community and two pilot offerings (see attached).
Therefore,

Be It Resolved That:

The Faculty Senate approve in principle the creation of an Honors Program, and
The Faculty Senate approve a pilot program to begin in Fall 2004, which consists of two core courses in the
Honors curricula and also satisfies General Education requirements: AS 3122 American People II and
CH2681 Introduction to European History.
