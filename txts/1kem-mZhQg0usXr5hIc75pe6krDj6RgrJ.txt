Approval of Minutes for Sep 24, 2021

Minutes are approved unanimously 			 

Faculty Senate Chair‚Äôs Report 

Thank everyone for the hard work 

LEC and GenEd framework

FRRC and academic grievance committees

EC working with Bylaws Working Group for the Committees Practices Survey

APPC ‚Äì survey about CR/NC limits and usage within departments\

IEC met today ‚Äì thanked participants ‚Äì regarding assessment, there is a lot of work people are doing ‚Äì 

Hanover enrollment is going forward and solicited feedback from faculty that was conveyed 

Working on institutional login for data and projects and reports

Presidential committees are largely constituted ‚Äì most nominations solidified 

Noticed no professional staff could nominate to Planning and Budget committee and president added two more members  				

President‚Äôs Report

Lisandra Ramos: Performance Planning (RFP) Update ‚Äì received 43 RFPs

Helping advance several goals (culture of excellence)

Curricular, non-curricular, infrastructure, capacity

In the vetting stage ü°™ PBC will review all proposals ü°™ Cabinet has the guidelines for approval

President Sams

Vision for the Community (inclusive, collaborative, shared governance, engaged community, informed)

Want to communicate with regularity ‚Äì use data that will inform 

Leadership teams and committees ‚Äì this will increase the number of people president can communicate with

Emphasis that communication is going out to the people who 

Executive leadership team ‚Äì middle management ‚Äì give people a chance to talk with president ‚Äì what have they heard from VP/Cabinet members (once a month)

Names of this group will be distributed 

EC will also communicate with the president what faculty needs are based on monthly meetings ‚Äì how to improve 

SGA leadership ‚Äì robust agenda ‚Äì 

Labor discussions every semester 

Working with Mike Kinane, once a month or once a semester for larger meetings ‚Äì we don‚Äôt have a standing opportunity to talk to staff

Student meetings ‚Äì meet so there‚Äôs more value and identity around the campus ‚Äì how does this manifest in OW experience

Faculty Senate and Full Faculty meetings ‚Äì but perhaps also other broader ways to communicate with these groups

Some of these are new ideas in 

Community-Building

Leading up to April ‚Äô22 presidential inauguration 

Look at activities associated with this

Tilling soil of identity so that the inauguration can be an opportunity to showcase ‚Äì how we behave, what we believe, how we demonstrate our excellence 

**What conversations about intentional and conscientious community ‚Äì what makes us special 

Community is active, intentional, no longer happenstance ‚Äì how do we actively move our values into our actions

School elections to spring semester ‚Äì social justice, sustainability, what do we teach and how do we teach it 

Reflect on how that happens here ‚Äì what makes us special

Possibility of presidential lecture ‚Äì who speaks to our specialness, how can we broadcast nationally/internationally? 

Someone to help us have that conversation 

Assessment 

We have to continue to deal with this

We are all responsible for this ‚Äì not just faculty 

This is institution-wide, 

***These articles are ONLY for improving practices ‚Äì are NOT for punishing faculty, ONLY for assessment 

Will be diligent that assessment is not used in this way 

Data used in handbook

Clear: this is not how assessment will be used 



Middle States Update (Mike Kavic, Cris Notaro, Frank Sanacory)

Supplemental Information Report - SIR (Mike Kavic)

Highlighting actions: Middle States reaffirmed accreditation and requested supplemental report ‚Äì in a particular area

We need to report on standards 3, 4, 5 (all related to assessment) 

Standard 3: student learning opportunities ‚Äì asking administrative assessment on learning 

Standard 4: report on assessment of student support programs 

Easiest ‚Äòlift‚Äô ‚Äì asking about student suppport services like tutoring activity, student affairs, but how we help students learn

We have been doing assessment but they wonder are we communicating how we are doing it ‚Äì are we mentioning topline agendas?

Standard 5: standard about assessment 

This touches on academic assessment

We need to provide evidence of this assessment

Development of PLSOs and dissemination to stakeholders nad campus community ‚Äì what are learning outcomes?

Closing the loop ‚Äì they believe we did assessment, but what was the clear indication of change ‚Äì addressing the results of the assessment

How are we providing evidence of that?

Building infrastructure and culture of assessment

Central campus-wide infrastructure to collect and communicate assessment (WEAVE)

Consequences 

We need to generate more reports

Public probation ‚Äì if we do not address

We could lose accreditation. We need accreditation or we can lose ability to receive federal and state aid without which we may close  

Frank Sanacory ‚ÄúOn SIR‚Äù

We want a report that demonstrates that we‚Äôre in compliance and doing what we said we‚Äôd do

What is evidence that we are continuing these efforts ‚Äì progress ‚Äì and continual and across-campus 

40 pgs or less ‚Äì it is not as involved as previous report

Middle States‚Äô liaison has met several times and there‚Äôs a consultant to point out any holes in response 

We need college-wide, sustainable assessment 

We need to encourage with any means necessary 

LEC and Fellows collect evidence 

Cris Notaro

Presented the people who are involved in assessment 

There are teams: ‚Äò evidence‚Äô and ‚Äòwriting‚Äô and ‚Äòadvisory‚Äô and the ‚Äòconsultants‚Äô

First draft expected in early December 

Questions 

(Peter Ikeler): Equity of who is undertaking additional assessment, is there compensation? 		

Mike Kavic response: equity is important. The intention of this was to make sure we get accreditation not to make an inequity situation ‚Äì and we will try to design a system that is not over burdensome but channels the self-improvement process and demonstrates this process to Middles States

Question (Lee Blackstone): What is the plan to keep assessment going? How will we sustain this? Does this require more money and how will we do this?

Mike Kavic response: Middle States‚Äô standards ‚Äì want to know if we‚Äôre presenting something as a ‚Äòone off‚Äô or a sustainable program ‚Äì they will know if it‚Äôs just to get through this. We are planning carefully about future ‚Äì Ryoko and Ashlee have more plans about assessment fellows. Points out that 

Question (Martha Livingston): PH since 2014 assessment to receive national accreditation in public health ‚Äì required a lot of work by PH faculty ‚Äì continue to do so without any compensation or course release  

Mike Kavic response: it is a great program and appreciates the work 



Co-directors of Academic Assessment Report (Ashlee Lien and Ryoko Yamamoto)

Jan 2020 appointed ‚Äì Ashlee Lien (Institutional-Level Student Learning outcomes emphasis) and Ryoko Yamamoto (Degree program Student learning outcomes emphasis) 

Ryoko Yamamoto: Assessment?

Not just data, but identify goals, makes plans to achieve goal, collect data to see if achieving, observe data, make plans to correct, and then check if those new plans achieve goals 

Ashlee Lien: ISLO Assessment 

How is it going? How do we know? How can we address issues? 

LEC oversees curriculum and how GenEd standards are implemented at Old Westbury 

LEC has assessed ISLOs for a long time ‚Äì learning outcome assessments and a syllabus assessment review 

Disjointed, one internally for LEC and one institutional and official 

we are trying to ensure this is all connected

done once every 5 years (sometime within that period) 

Middle States: you‚Äôve done assessment but how does it inform changes to curriculum and use of data AND communication back to departments (closing the loop)

LEC work and ongoing work:

Spring 2020 ‚Äì look at where we are and where we need to be

Developed: 5-Phase cycle of LEP assessment ‚Äì builds in Closing the Loop activities (every 5 years and we know where we are in cycle at any given period)

Rubric development (AY 21-22)

For each domain 

LEP Assessment Manual (AY 21-22)

Makes sure the chair knows how to implement once they start

Phases 1-3 Assessment (Spring ‚Äô22)

Assessment is occurring in Liberal Education curriculum ‚Äì they will be in touch with anyone teaching in this

LEAP+ Transition / SUNY Gen Ed (AY 22-23)

How our current structure with overlay with the new guidelines 

Important because this is where faculty control of assessment and curriculum

This cycle will give us a way to have institutional support and a way to communicate assessments  

Ryoko Yamamoto PSLO

All the schools have different histories and different assessments ‚Äì 

Middle States thought that SOB and SOE had resources to support full cycle assessment 

SAS lack systemic data collection for closing the loop process in SAS and SPS

Not that these aren‚Äôt completed, but there were not communicated adequately 

Feedback was that these were ‚Äúnot sufficiently linked to a discipline‚Äù PSLOs

Lack of systematic sharing of assessment tools and findings with stakeholders 

Emphasis: organized process, resources, documentation, teaching-curriculum-assessment link 

Actions taken:

Program Assessment Plan

Year-End Degree Program Report

Assessment Fellows Program (AY20-21)

Prep for the Assessment Coordinators System (pending funding)

‚ÄúTraining trainers‚Äù

Interdepartmental network ‚Äì collective problem-solving 

Make sure we‚Äôre communicating with one another between departments 

Refine the S21 Program Assessment Plan 

Where are we?

Built-in ‚ÄúClosing the Loop‚Äù process for ISLO assessment

Systematic and regular PSLO assessment and SAS and SPS has been set up 

Basic tools: PSLOs, curriculum maps, Multi-year strategic assessment schedule

Plans for assessment data sharing, analysis, and utilization

Assessment coordinator system (pending funding)

Documentation of emerging data utilization (Closing Loop)

Document and info sharing with stakeholders: Website & Weave+

Moving ahead

Establish regular and meaningful assessment

We have to follow through the assessment plan with adjustments

Improve data equality (not methodological perfectionism)

We need the BIG picture, not variability of learning outcomes 

Active usage of assessment data and creative data gathering = faculty ownership

not for punishment but resource to improve practices ‚Äì this data should be useful to us: to Middle States but we can use this to show to students and prospective students

periodic review of instruments (PSLOs, CM, schedule)

Assessment Coordinator System in SAS (SPS?)

What does SPS have/need for sharing data?

Enhanced documentation and annual training for ISLO assessment

Facilitate the ecosystem for meaning assessment

Annual assessment calendar and college-wide events so people know what to expect during the year

Trust building and safeguarding ‚Äì assessment is act of acknowledging our shortcoming and reflecting on that

Scary if there is no trust ‚Äì we don‚Äôt like being judged

Among faculty and with admin

We also need data safeguarded ‚Äì assessment report anonymous?  

Bottom-up, faculty-led structure for assessment policymaking

What to share, how much to share, how to share 

Academic assessment = curriculum evaluation and prioritizing 

Questions

Peter Ikeler: this is beyond what we do ‚Äì we revisit this often in our classes ‚Äì but how is this sustainable if people don‚Äôt have time for this and are already overburdened? At what point can we question the Middle States expectations for a college with fewer resources, why do we have to do all these extra things that may not be asked at other institutions with more resources 

Response: 

Ashlee Lien addressed that yes, we already do, how do we make this process less burdensome for faculty? Assessment coordinator could do a lot of the paperwork

Additional work? Perhaps departments need to discuss how do we check if the PSLOs are working? 

One ask may be ‚Äúcan we put this in a rubric‚Äù assignment?   

Duncan Quarless: with respects to other institutions ‚Äì other places are doing assessment (chemistry chair at Columbia) 

we just need to know what meets our needs 

non-academic assessment ‚Äì how can we be more effective at what we‚Äôre already doing? What tools will make this easier? 

We just want to make sure we have continuous improvement and institutional effectiveness?

In some cases, we need to ‚Äòstrategically re-align resources‚Äô to help us meet objectives/outcomes

We have to do across institute and sustain process 

Ryoko response

Other places do have a provost of assessment and are surprised that faculty at OW undertake assessment 

Does not like the artificial division of assessment and teaching

Workload ‚Äì three courses may be a lot but reducing that may make assessment more management 

Lee Blackstone

Regarding assessment/work: what is regular or already completed

The bureaucracy placed on us to account for our assessment ‚Äì this is too much

Ashlee Lien pointed out that perhaps academic assessments of student learning outcomes are already completed but perhaps less-so institutional assessment 

Mike Kavic pointed out that Courtney or Mike would help out if needed ‚Äì adding data to WEAVE

Ed Bever college has two ways to recognize teaching/work 

ARPT process but assessment was NOT measured 

Perhaps ARPT could make this a criteria? Governance would need to decide on this and offset other expectations

DSI process: academic affairs could indicate this was a priority and make a process for that

Alireza Ebrahimi ‚Äì SUNY has links for resources ‚Äì can there be a link for this process made available? 

Provost‚Äôs Report

Academic Affairs will identity DSI priorities ‚Äì service and governance ‚Äì informing institutional priorities in Middle States and this is not unusual  

Convocation ‚Äì thanked faculty participation ‚Äì students appreciated engagement

Tom Delgiudice representing faculty did a great job

Received favorably  

Student Fall semester survey

Pandemic has some effects that are ongoing ‚Äì want to know how students are coping

How the instructional modalities and support services are meeting needs

Student course evaluations

Open 11/30-12/15

Part B courses (SOB) ‚Äì 12/12-12/15

Can see how much students submit responses based on reminders ‚Äì more so, perhaps, than faculty reminders 

Suggesting days to give time 

Blue

Consider revising the objectives for course evaluations and identify what type of technology system meets the need

Assess cost-effectiveness in continuing the Blue service

Do we keep this? We‚Äôre using as simple tool but it can do a lot more

SUNY GE Implementation

Will likely receive additional implementation guidance from SUNY in roughly one month (Memorandum to President)

FS Chair and Laurie Morris may be contacted about implementation 

Will share document with faculty from Dr. Jim Malatras (Chancellor) presenting implementation framework and resolution

Graduate Diversity Fellowship Program (congrats for receiving)

Barbara Hillery will contact the graduate directors ‚Äì funds will go to graduate students who deserve/need funds 

LMS change (Moving to Brightspace)

Anticipate early next calendar year (training, documentation and videos)

Blackboard will continue through next calendar year

ITS will provide updates as they become available 

EIT Accessibility Update

CourseArc (onboarding next week) ‚Äì in response to a faculty request for some additional support 

Ally scan ‚Äì prioritized a list of 106 courses with EIT Accessibility Scores ‚Äì 50% or below

Chandra will reach out to the faculty of these courses to work with to fix these materials to improving accessibility moving into the spring 2022

Questions

Robert Mevissen: keeping Panopto?

Samara Smith: will we have a one-page high lights for what to keep or modify for EIT standards?

Ed Bever yes

Laurie Morris: wrote to Duncan about the Board of Trustees approval 



UUP Report (Martha Livingston)

It is good to hear President Sams‚Äô language about intentional community 

This is not translated to day-to-day lives of professionals ‚Äì some managers are not creating intentional community

168-hr week ‚Äì hours we spend on one project that we don‚Äôt spend on others 

This affects our ability to work on our own professional development 

All this technology = we need support to our IT staff and we need to support faculty having to learn about new systems 

COVID-19 = SUNY-UUP Individual Development Awards = lots of money and increasing the amount individuals can apply for (from $1000 to $2000)



NSB Renovation (Kinning Poon)

Growth in sciences and overview of sciences and student outcomes

Primary driver of tuition is enrollment and enrollment in sciences has steadily grown over current years 

Over 700 students (13% of total enrollment)

Large percentage underrepresented minorities (near 60%)

Aligns with Presidents Sams‚Äô statement about more competitive college generally and for underrepresented students

CSTEP and LSAMP ‚Äì federally funded ‚Äì these give students monetary and academic support

Graduate rates ‚Äì trying to bridge gap with URMs and non-URMS

BS has graduate 45% URM graduates in last 5 years

Faculty goals: 

Course Embedded Undergraduate Research Experiences (CURES)

Driven by faculty research

Greater retention when CURES used earlier (intro courses)

Need more infrastructure for CURES ‚Äì students spill out into faculty labs

Problem with comments that make it seem we do not have culture of research, so it‚Äôs hard to win more grants 

Applied learning 

Working conditions: 

Building 40 years old, it is falling apart and has many majors housed there 

Surpassed enrolled by 3 years (outgrown building) 

Major issues (ventilation, inadequate space, temp problems, mold, interruptions, NMR temporary HVAC)

Far less space compared to other campuses ‚Äì this makes us less attractive to students 

Timeline

This started in 2010, published survey in 2016, 2018 told renovation and spall addition, 2019-20 ‚Äì just renovation, fall 2021 ‚Äì all different

Only Phase 1, no guaranteed Phase 2 

Where would faculty go?

Nearly one-third of budget for temporary trailers ‚Äì this is not helping issue of space  

Problematic for OW 

Reverse enrollment growth in sciences 

Impact revenue 

Affects everyone ‚Äì SOE majors in sciences, everyone takes one natural science 

Impacts student and the research of faculty ‚Äì who mentor those students 

Appeal

Need to prioritize the renovations

Need extension of lab space ‚Äì for the growth in sciences

Want single phase renovations 

No trailers ‚Äì capital used for permanent improvement

Questions

Update moving forward ‚Äì what are the next steps?

Manya Mascareno: President Sams understands the stakes and is trying to reach out to SUNY at different levels, working with Ray to update stats, brought to Chancellor Malatras  

Laurie Morris: private/public partnerships? SUNY may match if we can secure some private funds  

SGA Announcements (Janay Jackson)

Working on better relationship with university police ‚Äì created committee to spearhead events

 Working on joining more committees ‚Äì closer connection with faculty and administration 	

Maybe more students not in SGA could get connection

Sense of inclusion between online, on campus ‚Äì better sense of union

Want more normalcy on campus 

Want campus to be comfortable for all students 

Adjournment	

Adjourned by unanimous consent
