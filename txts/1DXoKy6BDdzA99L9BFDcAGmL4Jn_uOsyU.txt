ARPT Committee

Motion: Authorization to Fill ARPT Vacancy
Background: The ARPT Committee is requesting appointment of a tenured or untenured
member of the School of Education Faculty to replace the elected SOE representative, who has
resigned to fulfill other College duties. The By-Laws provide that the SOE representative should
be a tenured faculty member; however, preliminary consultation indicates that it may be
difficult to find a tenured SOE faculty member able to serve. ARPT is therefore requesting
expansion of the candidate pool to include both tenured and untenured faculty. ARPT notes
that there is precedent for such an expansion; the Senate authorized appointment of tenured
or untenured members for the Spring 2012 semester and perhaps on prior occasions.
Motion: That the Faculty Senate approve appointment of either a tenured or an untenured
member of the School of Education faculty to fill the existing vacancy in the School of
Education’s mandated ARPT seat. The prospective member will be identified in consultation
with the Interim Dean of the School of Education and will be appointed to serve for the
Academic Year 2014–2015.
