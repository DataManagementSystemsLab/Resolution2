Assessment

faculty of the Community Colleges have consistently supported
campus-based assessment and, to that end, the faculty and the
come together to work on the GEAR (General Education
Review) Initiative; and

Whereas over the last two years the GEAR Committee has diligently reviewed

the General Education Assessment Plans of the 57 campuses involved with

general education programs; and

Whereas GEAR provides each campus with an appropriate plan for assessing its
own general education program. In addition, each campus has negotiated a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Provost's office, providing an
ongoing mechanism for the college and System Administration to review the
program’s success; and
Whereas both GEAR and the MOU hold the campuses to the highest standards
of academic rigor, demonstrating the faculty’s commitment to quality and
accountability in higher education; and
Whereas while the faculty of the Community Colleges have endorsed faculty-

driven campus-based assessment plans such as GEAR, the faculty do not

support a system-wide plan for the use of common metrics to assess student
learning outcomes; and
Whereas although the faculty have been almost unanimous in opposition to
system-wide assessment, they have met with the Provost and Associate Provost
at the Chancellor’s request to discuss the issue, with the understanding that no
system-wide assessment plan would move forward without the imprimatur of the
University Faculty; and
Whereas given our collegial relationship with System Administration, we were
greatly shocked at Trustee de Russy’s resolution of June 9 calling for systemwide testing for learning outcomes and by the Chancellor's subsequent resolution
calling for system-wide assessment, the passing of which by the Board of
Trustees circumvented a negotiating process the faculty had entered into in good

faith with the Provost's office. Therefore, be it

Resolved that the Faculty Council of Community Colleges respectfully requests
that the SUNY Board of Trustees reconsider this resolution; and be it further
Resolved that the Faculty Council of Community Colleges respectfully requests
that the SUNY Board of Trustees allow the Community College faculty to
proceed unimpeded with their current approved plans of general education
assessment.
