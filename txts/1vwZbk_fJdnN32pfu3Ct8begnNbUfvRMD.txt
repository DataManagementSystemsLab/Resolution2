Annual Report of the Senate Chair (academic year 2013-14):
submitted by Duncan Quarless, August 8, 2014 (including summer activity to date). I will report on potential
nomination status for senate chair in a separate communication. Recommend however that the senate
consider a bylaws revision that would include chair (and all the other officers of the Senate – Executive
Committee) in the standing committees election process and timetable.

B. Outstanding Business of the Senate from 2012-13 (undertaken in 2013-14):
There were several items from 2012-13 which required follow-up actions during this past year:
1. Vote on bylaws amendments (Article I and Article VI) (ballot passed ref. W. Sbaschnik, 6-6-14, for
Article I, 97 yes, 3 no, 0 abs.; for Article VI, 94 yes, 3 no, 0 abs.)
2. Report on other potential bylaws revisions (presented to Senate, May 23, 2014 – accepted 6-3-14)
3. Follow-up review on Seamless Transfer implementation process (GE and transfer paths) (Final Report
presented to Senate, May 23, 2014 – accepted 6-3-14)
4. Address faculty responsibility in terms of the culture for shared governance and the administrative
responsibility for the institutional climate for shared governance (resolutions were crafted, presented and
approved by Senate – 2-28-14 and 6-3-14, respectively). There were three other related proposed
items from 2012-13: post-tenure & 360 reviews, and attendance in the Senate to be included in the
Chair’s annual report and reported regularly to Senate. The executive committee also felt that some
type of “State of the Senate” summary for the year be reported in writing.
5. Continue work to improve transparency and communication in intersecting areas of governance (e.g.
student life issues that impact academics – financial cancellation, food services,
parking/transportation services, sexual harassment). I am happy to report the following for three
administration-side governance boards/committees (including some planned meeting times for the
fall 2014: I presume that these are closed meeting)
Transportation Advisory Board - Student Union
Student Health Advisory Board - Campus Center
312
I-100
Chair (vacant)
Chair, Sue Mundy (Director, Student Health Center)
Thursday, September 11, 1:30-2:30 pm
Thursday, October 2, 12:01-1:00 pm
Thursday, October 9, 1:30-2:30 pm
Thursday, November 13, 1:30-2:30 pm
Food Service Advisory Committee
Thursday, December 11, 1:30-2:30 pm
Arthur Angst (Associate Vice President, Business
Compliance) chairs this committee
6. Feature the work of the committees of the faculty to the Senate (present annual reports) (all of the
Standing Committees, Article VII, and most of the College-wide Committees, Appendix I, reported to
the Senate 2013-14). TLRC proposal was approved during 2012-13 without further action.
C. Actionable items – Outstanding Business of the Senate from 2013-14 (a type of “State of the Senate”
summary):
1. With respect to item 1 from 2012-13, as this ballot has passed, the Senate must decide on the means by
which electronic voting especially for committee elections will be conducted.
2. With respect to item 2 from 2012-13, most of the standing and college-wide committees of the faculty
reviewed their respective sections of the bylaws and made recommendations where applicable for potential

bylaws’ revisions. These committee reports were included in the bylaws report produced in 2013-14.
Recommend that the Faculty Rights and Responsibilities Committee take the bylaws report under
consideration during AY 2014-15 as part of a more comprehensive effort.
With respect to item 3 from 2012-13, the Seamless Transfer report included some fundamental findings on
our current curricula across the campus (GE and within majors). There are opportunities to use these
findings in a proactive way. For example:
a. propose transfer paths for majors where such do not currently exist
b. continue our review of curricula that can become more responsive to student needs through
contemporary pedagogical content revisions
c. continue our development of the GE program (disaggregating requirements, goals and
learning outcomes: GE from institutional ones)
d. build on existing curricula to produce new curricula (note CAP resolutions for Program
Announcements and Letters of Intent – summarized in sections D. 8. and E. below)
With respect to item 4 from 2012-13, two resolutions were passed by the Senate 2013-14. The Culture
resolution subsequently prompted a couple potential actions – the proposal to develop Faculty Senate
Service Awards, and a recommendation for a review of the bylaws’ provisions in
prompting/compelling greater participation by tenured faculty (e.g. faculty senate exec should be a
tenured group?); the Climate resolution was passed at the end of the academic year and thus needs
some practical follow-up actions. The FRR committee may want to undertake a process to
operationalize post-tenure and 360 reviews (i.e. create them as sub-committees or ex-officio working
groups of the FRRC?). Still attempting to organize/establish/maintain accurate senate attendance
spreadsheet in order to include an attendance report.
With respect to item 5 from 2012-13, several developments were noted in 2013-14: the Presidential Task
Force on Financial Cancellation (TFFC) produced a report with recommendations, most of which were
adopted with a progressive implementation timetable; the Administration identified the chairs for some of
its boards/committees (e.g. food services committee); an ad hoc Sexual Harassment Committee remained
intact. There are ongoing concerns here: some follow-up with the ad hoc committees of the Senate
may be in order (i.e. branding, and sexual harassment); the progress on the President’s
implementation timetable (financial cancellation) – is scheduled for discussion and update in the
early fall 2014; there is some unfinished business with respect to crafting/establishing policy (i.e.
Anti-Fraternization and Consensual Sexual Relationship Policy); the Senate should not lose sight of
the ongoing “branding” process.
With respect to item 6 from 2012-13, the Senate experienced some positive momentum in terms of
committee reporting: a means to improve the transparency of committee operations, to provide greater
support for continuity and progress in committee activities year-to-year, to improve active participation by
committees in relationship to the decision-making activities of the Senate, and to cultivate
mentorship/leadership in governance. It is recommended that the Senate support these efforts in order
to both gauge and advance its progress in governance. Any annual committee reports submitted for
this year will be sent to the newly elected committee chairs early in the fall 2014. To date only two
committees have accomplished this: FUAC, and FJC. Based upon committee annual reports, the
senate should consider any outstanding item(s) that may be featured from these reports.
Recommend that annual reports have a target date before the beginning of summer where possible
(may require some language revision in the bylaws).
Secretary/Treasurer’s Report:
a. Executive Committee had some difficulty deciding on an appropriate template for reporting
meeting minutes. Will make a recommendation about this to the next senate executive
committee.
b. Old Westbury Faculty Fund had an opening balance (as of 9-30-13 statement) of $1,396.81
($308.15 checking, $1,088.66 saving), $77.85 was withdrawn for costs associated with posthumous
Citation to honor Nelson Mandela, closing balance (as of 5-31-14 statement) of $1,321.23. It is
unclear what purpose the fund serves and has been dormant for the most part beyond
compounding interest for several years.

D. Open/Pending Items ending the year (for early consideration by the Senate in fall 2014):
1. Schedule Change (Senate passed a resolution at the end of the year which calls for establishing a joint task
force which will produce a report including recommendations prior to the end of the fall 2014 semester)
(several potential faculty appointments to this joint task force were discussed with the Provost. The
task force will be convened early in the fall with a targeted report of findings and recommendation
before the end of the fall semester).
2. Residency Requirement (Provost announced that the administration is considering a potential change in
the residency requirement, which was also presented as a follow-up agenda item at the Provost Council
Meeting – 5-8-14). Reduce the requirement from 48 to 40 credits. (The Provost met with Senate Chair
and plans to implement this change in the fall 2014). This change is largely aesthetic, as department
degree requirements will not be affected. It is unclear at this time what may be some of the longer-term
impacts – (e.g. time to degree, total credit burdens for degrees, etc.), but the rationale is that it may be
useful for our immediate enrollment needs/plans.
3. Seamless Transfer Implementation for General Education (implementation of agreed GE
program/bulletin changes) (This is part of an ongoing process in consultation with the Provost. Some
of these details may be more suitable for a separate report/presentation to the faculty).
4. CAP – PA (Program Announcement: BS Environmental Science) (Some discussion with the Provost.
Will likely be presented in the fall 2014 as a program title that is more descriptive and consistent
with our mission).
5. Consultation in the area of institutional budgeting:
a. RABPC sub-group (faculty and professionals) met May 29, 2014 and a potential summer follow-up full
committee meeting may be scheduled. During the May 29, 2014 meeting the sub-group was presented
with some materials to aid our campus in the development of a vetting tool for Start-Up NY.
(Unfortunately I failed in the effort to work with the Provost to try to schedule a meeting of this
committee during the summer. Will recommend that the RABPC convene to move forward on
this and some related matters as early in the fall as possible).
b. Financial Cancellation Task Force operation (the co-chairs of this task force are trying to schedule a
meeting of the task force in the early fall – will ask faculty reps to update senate some time
thereafter).
c. Budgetary principles related to Letts. of Intent vs. Prog. Announcements (Recommend that this
discussion happen before the senate, after CAP and the RABPC have had an opportunity to
interact with the Provost and the CFO).
6. Develop review criteria for leadership in shared governance: i.e. Senate Chair, Campus President,
Executive Committee. (An) assessment tool(s) of some kind would be extremely helpful for faculty
governance.
7. Resolution on Inclusion of Social Justice Component in Majors (Senate agreed to offer a modified
resolution in 2014-15, need follow-up on this in the fall 2014 – some members of the senate agreed to
help to revise the language including the English department senator).
8. Degree Initiatives. In addition to the presentation of one minor from Modern Languages, there were 10
proposed curricular degree initiatives voted upon by the senate as presented by CAP (two Program
Announcements (PAs) and eight Letters of Intent (LOIs)) (refer to E. below – dates: 5-9-14 and 5-23-14).
As far as I am aware, one PA is yet to be announced by SUNY, and the other has been held for further
internal review and development prior to submission to SUNY. In the case of the several LOIs that have
been announced by SUNY, the College has yet to receive official approval letters from SUNY.
Presumably the Provost will update us on that status as progress is made.
9. ARPT. The college’s growth and transition is reflected in a large work volume of the Appointment,
Reappointment, Promotion and Tenure Committee. It is important that this committee be fully constituted.
There may be periodic need for the appointment of tenured faculty on this committee.
