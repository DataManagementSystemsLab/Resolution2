Resolution to Create the Innovation Laboratory
Whereas in response to the public health COVID-19 crisis SUNY Old Westbury transitioned to
remote teaching during the Spring 2020 semester which has continued through both the Fall
2020 and Spring 2021 semesters, and
Whereas the faculty rose to the challenge of reestablishing their teaching practice in new or
unfamiliar modes of instruction including remote synchronous and remote hybrid/blended, and
Whereas there is already a Distance Learning Policy1, which formally requires that faculty must
complete the appropriate modality training offered by Distance Learning in order to teach in
hybrid and NET (asynchronous online) modalities, and
Whereas faculty who have already been trained in asynchronous online and/or hybrid/blended
teaching modalities will maintain credentials for teaching in those modalities, and
Whereas there have been no previous training modules in Remote synchronous teaching, and
Whereas the policy requiring training in hybrid/blended teaching was suspended to give faculty
flexibility in using asynchronous elements in combination with Remote synchronous instruction
during the crisis, and
Whereas individual experiential learning risks missing possibilities and implementing less than
optimum solutions that exposure to alternative approaches and reflection on successes and
failures can help avoid, and
Whereas faculty experience with Remote synchronous teaching is currently the best source of
knowledge about best practices and potential pitfalls of this modality, and
Whereas faculty who adopted hybrid/blended structures combining asynchronous and Remote
synchronous instruction would seem to be likely to benefit more from collegial interactions to
round out their familiarity with the best practices and potential pitfalls of hybrid/blended
pedagogy than from more standardized training sessions at this point,
Be it therefore resolved that the Teaching Learning Resource Committee, along with the Center
for Excellence in Teaching and Learning and the Office for Distance Learning create the
Innovation Laboratory as described in the Call for Proposals (attached) to share our expertise
and support faculty in teaching in innovative ways.
