General Criteria for Chancellor’s Awards
NATURE OF THE PROGRAM
The Chancellor’s Awards for Excellence are System-level honors conferred to acknowledge and provide
system-wide recognition for superior professional achievement and to encourage the ongoing pursuit of
continuous academic excellence. These programs underscore SUNY’s commitment to sustaining
intellectual vibrancy, advancing the boundaries of knowledge, providing the highest quality of instruction,
and serving the public good.
REWARDS OF SELECTION
Individuals selected for this tribute are the SUNY community’s role models. In acknowledgment of their
selection, recipients will be given recognition by the addition of the phrase "State University Chancellor's
Award for Excellence in …,” where appropriate. A letter, certificate, and a Chancellor’s Award for
Excellence Medallion are also bestowed upon the recipient to commemorate the honor. In addition,
campuses are encouraged to supplement these commemoratives as appropriate to campus resources.
Frequently, those selected are honored by their campuses during commencement, at academic
convocations, or at special events hosted in honor of their selection.
CAMPUS PARTICIPATION
All State University of New York campuses may nominate candidates for these awards: doctoral degree
granting institutions, university colleges, technology colleges, and community colleges. Campus
participation in the programs, however, is at the discretion of the campus President but all campuses
are encouraged to participate.
NUMBER OF NOMINATIONS (NOMINATION ALLOCATIONS)
A limit is placed on the number of candidates a campus may submit to each award program in
order to preserve the honor and prestige associated with the selection. These caps are
formula-driven and based on the ratio to campus Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) students.
Regardless of the ratio, each campus may submit at least one nomination to each award program
annually. Nomination allocations are not interchangeable from program to program, nor can they be
carried forward from year-to-year. Campuses that submit more than their prescribed nominations will
have all nominations returned without review.
There is no requirement to nominate annually, nor will the absence of submissions in any cycle be
detrimental to campus nominations made in subsequent cycles.

CANDIDATE’S CHARACTERISTICS
Individuals nominated for these awards must meet all prescribed eligibility criteria and must be individuals
who have made an exceptional contribution to the State University and its students. They must be
respected by the campus community and worthy of emulation by colleagues and students on the home
campus and across SUNY.
There are also circumstances that preclude nomination regardless of the program. The following are
special conditions that limit eligibility and these restrictions apply to all programs:
•
•
•
•

•

nominated for an Excellence Award in any of the categories;
Recipients of an Excellence Award may not be nominated for another Excellence Award within a
five-year interval;
Recipients of an Excellence Award many not be re-nominated for an award in the same category;
The chief campus officer for academic, student, or administrative affairs, or persons serving in these
capacities, may not be nominated for an Excellence Award. Other exclusions include the

and Labor Relations, and of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University; and
Posthumous nominations are ineligible.

ELIGIBILITY AND SELECTION CRITERIA SPECIFIC TO THE
CHANCELLOR’S AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN ADJUNCT TEACHING
EXCELLENCE IN ADJUNCT TEACHING (EIAT)
Nature of the Program
The Chancellor’s Award for Excellence in Adjunct Teaching recognizes consistently superior teaching at
the graduate, undergraduate, or professional level in keeping with the State University’s commitment to
providing its students with instruction of the highest quality.
The ratio of FTE students to nominees for the Chancellor’s Award for Adjunct Teaching shall be
the same as the ratio for the nominees for the Chancellor’s Award for Excellence in Full-time
Teaching. Note: This ratio is currently 1 nominee per 2,000 FTEs.
SELECTION CRITERIA
The primary criterion is skill in teaching.
Teaching Techniques and Representative Materials – There must be positive evidence that the
candidate performs superbly in educational environments. The nominee must maintain instructional
policies that adapt readily to student needs, interests and problems. Mastery of teaching techniques
must be demonstrated and substantiated.
Candidates' evaluations of students' work must be strongly supported by evidence. When available,
student evaluations (in the form of student questionnaires administered and compiled by persons other
than the nominee) may provide a clear idea of the nominee’s effectiveness in teaching.
Additional consideration, as appropriate, may be given to:
•
•
•
•

Outstanding support for the intellectual growth of individual students;
Demonstrated use of relevant contemporary data from their discipline(s) in their teaching.
Evidence may be scholarly and/or widely recognized experience in the field;
Number of students per course; and
Different teaching techniques employed.

Eligibility Criteria Specific to the EIAT
•
•
•
•
3

Nominees must be Adjunct Faculty as generally defined by the specific SUNY institution.
Individuals serving in full-time professional or academic positions at a SUNY institution are not
eligible for this award;
Nominees must have taught, over the proceeding five years, a total of courses equivalent to onehalf of a three-year full-time teaching load in the appropriate department;
Nominees may also serve in adjunct roles at other educational institutions; and
Nominees must be employed by the nominating campus at the time of the nomination.

SELECTION PROCESSES
Campuses are required to empanel a specifically-constituted committee to elicit nominations, evaluate
candidates, and recommend to the campus President the candidates to go forward to the System
Administration level. The following describes the overarching and program-specific requirements.
CAMPUS NOMINATION PROCESS
The programs require that nominations coming forward to the System Administration level be the product
of an objective and rigorous campus review. Further, the nomination process should benefit from the
involvement of a broad spectrum of the campus community including faculty, students, and administration.
Under no circumstance may individuals apply – or self-nominate – for these awards.
The nomination requirements are as follows:
CAMPUS REVIEW
As previously noted, the awards require the establishment of a committee specifically charged with
selecting the campus’s nominees. In addition, the programs go on to specify the construct of the
committees.
Committee Appointment and Structure – The campus selection committees for these awards shall be
appointed by the campus governance structure (as is currently done by each campus for appointment of
other faculty committees) with the concurrence of the campus President. The committee shall include the
chair (or chair’s designee) of the campus faculty governance organization; one member, designated by the
campus President, to act in an ex-officio capacity; and full-time and part-time faculty and student
representation.
Campus Selection Committee Role – The primary evaluation of the nominee's qualifications is the
responsibility of the campus. The local Selection Committee solicits nominations; conducts an
objective and rigorous evaluation of the merits of candidates nominated; recommends to the
campus President nominees to go forward to System Administration; and prepares the final
nomination portfolio. Consequently, nominations received at System Administration should represent the
campus’s finest exemplars of the qualities recognized through these awards.
The campus Selection Committee shall make its report in the form of a recommendation to the campus
President, and shall forward to the campus President no more than the number of nominations allowed.
Nominations endorsed by the campus President shall be forwarded to the Program Manager for Faculty
and Staff Awards, Office of the Senior Vice Chancellor and Provost at System Administration.
Note: The campus process may be more extensive and its requirements more stringent than the
requirements outlined in these program guidelines. However, they cannot be less rigorous than the
program requirements highlighted here.

Confidentiality
Selection for an Excellence Award is an event of great joy and pride for the recipient and the campus.
Conversely, non-selection generates enormous disappointment. The sensitivities inherent in such
recognition programs and the nature of the supporting documentation involved make is
imperative that all deliberations of the campus committee remain strictly confidential. (Ideally, this
should extend to the identity of those selected by the local Selection Committee as the campus’
nominees for these awards.)
Because of the confidential nature of these proceedings, the System Administration Program Manager of
these awards will interact only with the campus President, campus chief academic officer, or the
President’s designee.
SUPPORT FILE
The campus Selection Committee is responsible for preparing the nomination portfolio submitted to
System Administration. For each nominee, the campus must submit one original hard copy (additional
copies are not necessary) of the nomination portfolio. It must be collated in the order presented below
and must include the following:
Checklist Cover Sheet – This form must be the first sheet of the nominee’s portfolio. It is
used to ensure compliance with the program policies and procedures, and for administrative
purposes. The form is appended to these guidelines. The Checklist contains the certifications
regarding the candidate’s eligibility and campus compliance with the program policies and
procedures. The campus President must sign the Checklist. Nominations received without this
endorsement will receive technical disqualifications.
Transmittal Letter – A brief transmittal letter addressing how the candidate meets the selection
criteria is required from the campus President. This letter should reflect the rationale the campus
committee used to make the nomination and speaks specifically to the candidate’s merit. The
letter should be addressed to the State University Provost, State University of New York,
System Administration, 353 Broadway, Albany, New York 12246-2915. A separate letter
must accompany each nomination.
Nomination Procedures – A brief explanation is required that describes the mechanism by
which nominations were solicited, what evidence was examined by the local Selection Committee
in the evaluation of nominees, and how the local committee arrived at its selection.
Summary Presentation – The Summary Presentation provides the rationale for the campus’s
nomination of a particular candidate and sets forth candidate merit for selection. It should reflect
the committee’s objectivity and impartiality in coming to its decision in what is generally a highly
competitive campus process.

5

The Summary Presentation is the primary documentation available to those involved in the System-level
review to explain the campus’ rationale for nominating the candidate for this honor. It must address
how the candidate excels in each criterion for selection for the award to which the candidate is
nominated (e.g., if there are three selection criteria, then candidate’s performance in each must be
described), the candidate’s most outstanding qualifications and major achievements attained. The
quality of the evidence provided is critical to recommendation. Although excerpts from the
recommendations can and should be included, the Summary Presentation must be more than a
testimonial. There must be specific, concrete examples of how the nominee fulfills each criterion.
Summary Presentations should not be written by the nominee (or in the first person) because this
undermines the impartiality and objectivity required of the nomination process. The Summary
Presentation is limited to a maximum of five pages, excluding the cover sheet.
Note: Additional Support File Requirements
□ Current Curriculum Vitae (CV): An up-to-date and moderately detailed CV
containing information on the nominee's career must be included in the nomination
portfolio.
□ Substantiation for Chancellor’s Award for Excellence in Adjunct Teaching: Substantiation
that the Nominee has taught, over the proceeding five years, a total of courses equivalent to onehalf of a three-year full-time teaching load in the appropriate department.
Note: None of the nominating documentation will be returned to the campus. We are not able to
accept electronic nomination submissions via e-mail at this time.
SUBMISSION
Forwarding Address – The original of the nomination portfolios are to be sent to (no additional copies
required):
Ms. Yvette Roberts, Program Manager for Faculty and Staff Awards
Office of the Senior Vice Chancellor and Provost
State University of New York, System Administration
State University Plaza, Room S525
Albany, New York 12246-2915

Deadline – To facilitate the nomination process on campuses, the deadline for the current program
cycle is being provided. All nomination portfolios must be received by the Program Manager on
or before Tuesday, of the second week of November, with award announcements to be made in
mid/late February. Submission deadlines:
Tuesday, November 13, 2018 for Academic Year 2018-2019
Tuesday, November 12, 2019 for Academic Year 2019-2020

SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION REVIEW
Each nomination will be reviewed for compliance using the SUNY-wide criteria for selection and eligibility.
This means that each nominee’s portfolio will be examined to confirm the individual’s eligibility
and to ensure that the portfolio contains substantive evidence (as opposed to testimonials)
in support of each selection criterion for the particular award. This evidence is critical to the
recommendation process.
Omission can lead (and has led) to the elimination of potential candidates.
Where a candidate is not being recommended for selection, the campus President, campus chief
academic officer, or the President’s designee will be contacted and offered the option of providing
the information sought by reviewers, or of withdrawing the nomination from consideration. This
also is treated in a confidential manner. Contact with the campus President will be made prior
to making award recommendations to the Chancellor.
After review, nominees recommended for this honor will have their names forwarded to the Chancellor
through the Office of the Senior Vice Chancellor and Provost at System Administration. Selection is
contingent upon approval of recommendations by the Chancellor. The SUNY Board of Trustees is not
involved in the Excellence Awards process.
Failure by a campus to comply with the procedures established for the selection of nominees will
result in the disqualification of all nominees from that institution.
SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION
The nominations will be evaluated at the SUNY-wide level and award announcements will be made by
mid/late February.
Informal notification occurs via e-mail to the campus President once approval of recommendations
has been received by the Chancellor. Formal notification is done by letter from the Chancellor to
the recipient with a copy to the campus President. The recipient’s original award letter, certificate
and medallion will be mailed to the campus President for presentation to the recipient. It is more
efficient to handle in this manner for those campuses that wish to present recipients with their
award during commencement, at academic convocations, or at a special event in honor of their
selection.
These guidelines are also available online at the Office of the Senior Vice Chancellor and Provost, and
can be accessed at: http://system.suny.edu/academic-affairs/faculty-staff-awards/.
