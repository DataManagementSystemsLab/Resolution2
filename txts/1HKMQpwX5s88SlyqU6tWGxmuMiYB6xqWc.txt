Motion on Reappointment of Dr. Jane Weiss, presented by Chris
Hobson. Seconded by J. Edelson.

Discussion:
L. Walsh: point of information: what does Board of Trustees say about this?
Does the President have the right to appoint faculty? Are arguing that Senate
should review or recommend ARPT reccommdations
H.Lewittes: Senate can recommend action or approve or disapprove of actions
of Administration
Mukherji: ARPT, a voice of faculty governance, is a standing committee of the
Senate and makes its reccomedations to the Senate, which presents it to the

Administration. Senate as representing faculty can certainly voice its approval
when Administration acts contrary to the recommendation of faculty
governance.
L. Walsh: friendly amendment. Delete the word ‘impermissible’ in the
resolution.
