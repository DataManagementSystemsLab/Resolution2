Introduction
▪

In the following report, Hanover Research presents the results of a Student Choice Survey of
students accepted to U.S. University for the fall 2018 semester.

▪

The purpose of the survey is to gain a greater understanding of the factors that students weigh
when considering whether or not to enroll at U.S. University. The survey also assesses
respondents’ overall opinions of U.S. University and why they did or did not enroll.

▪

Hanover surveyed students accepted to U.S. University, including matriculating and nonmatriculating undergraduate and graduate students. Respondents are distributed as follows:

Methodology
▪

This analysis includes responses from 445 students who were admitted to U.S.
University for the fall 2018 term. Of those, 280 chose to enroll (matriculating students),
and 253 did not enroll (non-matriculating students).

▪

Sample sizes vary across questions because some questions only pertain to a subset of
respondents.

▪

Conclusions drawn from a small sample size (n<20) should be interpreted with caution.

▪

Statistically significant differences (95% confidence level) between groups are noted
with an asterisk (*).

▪

This report includes key insights from the survey, along with visualizations of aggregate
results and select charts by enrollment status or program level. Topline results are
available in the accompanying data supplement, as well as segmentations by:

Recommendations
▪

U.S. University should continue to work with prospective students and their families to
educate them about the financial aid opportunities available, as well as additional ways to
obtain financial assistance. Financial aid and value for the cost are two of the three most
important factors for prospective students, particularly at the undergraduate level. About
half of non-matriculating students indicate that they did not attend U.S. University
because they could not afford to do so.

▪

U.S. University should continue to capitalize on its reputation for offering a good education,
but it should explore further ways to highlight the benefits of its location and unique
campus culture. In addition to affordability, academic quality and campus atmosphere are
particularly important to undergraduate students. About three-quarters of matriculating
students agree that U.S. University’s campus location in Location 1 is appealing, compared
to just over half of non-matriculating students.

▪

U.S. University should emphasize the quality of its academic programs and the professional
opportunities available to graduate students. Graduate students are less concerned about
financial aid and campus atmosphere compared to undergraduate students. However,
faculty-student interactions, professional connections, academic quality, and employment
prospects after graduation are all particularly important to graduate students.

Key Findings
Financial aid and cost of attendance are two of the
most influential factors in prospective students’
enrollment decisions. Half of respondents who
went elsewhere could not afford to attend U.S.
University, and about one-third received a better
package elsewhere.
o More than half (60%) of all respondents indicate
that financial aid was an important factor when
deciding where to apply for an academic program.
o Two-thirds of non-matriculating students would
have attended U.S. University if they were offered
a better financial aid package.

Undergraduate students generally place more
importance on the financial aid package than their
graduate student counterparts.
o A majority of undergraduates indicate that a
financial aid offer or lack of one was very
influential in their choice of where to enroll (63%).
o For graduate applicants, however, financial aid was
less influential in their decision making process
(24%).

Key Findings
▪

Students choose U.S. University because they
believe it is a good fit for them and because of the
financial aid packages offered.
o The most common reasons that students choose
to attend U.S. University are because it is a good
fit for what they want to study (63%), they were
offered a good financial aid package (40%), and
the location is appealing (28%).
o Only 5 percent of non-matriculating students
went elsewhere because U.S. University did not
offer their program or major of interest.

▪

Overall, respondents have a favorable opinion of
U.S. University.
o About 86 percent of respondents rate U.S.
University’s overall quality as good or excellent.
o Almost half of all respondents rate U.S. University
as among their top college choices, with another
16 percent indicating that U.S. University was
their number one choice.

and non-matriculating students, believe that it is

Key Findings
▪

A U.S. University education provides value, though
cost is a prohibitive factor for some students.
o More than half of respondents (55%) believe that
U.S. University offers a good or excellent overall
value for the cost.
o However, 47 percent of non-matriculating students
believe that the cost of tuition is too high for the
educational value that U.S. University offers.
o Graduate applicants believe that an education
from U.S. University is a good value for the cost
(85%) more so than do undergraduate applicants
(63%).

▪

Academic quality is one of the most important
factors to both graduate and undergraduate
students. Proximity to family/home and overall
value for the cost also matter to both groups.
o However, graduate students value employment
prospects, institutional reputation, and flexible
course schedule more than undergraduates.
o In comparison, financial aid package and campus
atmosphere are more important to undergraduate
students.

Key Findings
▪

Availability of academic programs of interest are
important, but respondents weigh other factors
more heavily.
o There are no significant differences between
matriculating and non-matriculating students’
rating of the importance of program availability.
o However, matriculating students also are more
likely to agree (92%) that U.S. University offers a
wide variety of interesting academic programs
than are non-matriculating students (65%).

▪

Respondents prefer to communicate with higher
education institutions via digital channels.
o Most students prefer email communication,
though a substantial minority (41%) also like to
receive information via traditional postal mail.
o The two most popular social media platforms
through which respondents would prefer to
receive information is Facebook (71%) and
Instagram (52%), when respondents chose social
media as a preferred channel.
