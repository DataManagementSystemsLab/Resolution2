SUNY College at Old Westbury is a small, public college that teaches students to lead in work, in
the community, and in life. In an environment that demands academic excellence and offers close
interaction between students, faculty and staff, Old Westbury has woven diversity and intercultural
understanding into the very fiber of its liberal arts and professional curricular. Our endeavor is to
stimulate in students a passion for learning, and a commitment to building a more just world for
the future of humankind.
