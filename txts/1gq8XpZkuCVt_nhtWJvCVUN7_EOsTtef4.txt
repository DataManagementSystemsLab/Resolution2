Resolution
On Electronic Communication in Campus Governance
Proposed for consideration by the Faculty Senate
Whereas The Faculty Senate of the College at Old Westbury is considering a “Faculty Culture
Resolution” (dated 12/6/13) that includes in its first point of resolution that the faculty
shall, through their expertise, experience, mentorship and by shouldering an
equitable share of the burdens of those responsibilities, specifically model
and instantiate behaviors that support and strengthen faculty governance;
AND
Whereas the work of governance, like other business, requires that information and actions be
requested with reasonable confidence of reply;
AND
Whereas electronic communication, particularly in the form of “e-mail” is normative or nearly so
in offices of all sorts in this country;
AND
Whereas the College at Old Westbury has recently implemented a serviceable e-mail interface;
AND
Whereas the typical schedules, of faculty and administration at the College make it difficult or
impossible to meet face to face for all the business that is necessary for the work of governance;

THEREFORE BE IT
Resolved that faculty, administration and staff accept as normative that a request sent by campus
e-mail for information or for action pertaining to governance receive a response within a
reasonable length of time; for example, five working days;
AND BE IT
Resolved that this norm be understood to include the workings of departments, schools, and the
administration responsible for oversight of the College as a whole, so that those making this
commitment include faculty, departments, deans, administration and support staff, when in
communication with one another.
