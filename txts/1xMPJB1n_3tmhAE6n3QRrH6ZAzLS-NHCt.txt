State University of New York (SUNY)
2022/23 Executive Budget Summary: January 18, 2022
Today, Governor Hochul released her first Executive Budget, outlining the framework of a once-in-a-generation
investment in New York State that focuses on many areas, but of paramount importance to SUNY is a proposed multi-year
investment in SUNY Operations. This proposal, and its component pieces, marks the most significant investment in SUNY –
and postsecondary education – in over two decades, and includes (SUNY specific highlights below / detail follows):
-

Full support of all funding provided in the 21/22 Enacted Budget with no reductions,
Support for the hiring of additional full-time faculty at State-operated campuses and Community Colleges,
Elimination of the “TAP Gap” fully in 22/23, as opposed to the multi-year phase in included in the 21/22 Enacted,
A 100 percent funding floor for the Community Colleges, as well as flat per student funding,
Full support for State-operated Campus employee benefits and debt service costs,
Large-scale investments in the Opportunity Programs, approximately 10 percent, and
$10.8M in new, one-time, Direct State Tax Support for the expansion of Child Care Centers across SUNY

These noted investments are on top of an acceleration of the “re-set” of the Excelsior Scholarship Program Tuition
Rate to current year levels starting in 22/23, adjustments to the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) for Part-Time students in
degree (and non-degree) programs and TAP for incarcerated individuals, and a proposal to streamline the State Education
Department (SED) academic program review process. In addition, significant attention was paid to SUNY’s capital needs,
with $1.2B in capital funding being made available through either new sources, or redirection of existing.
While many of you are very familiar with the process of the New York State Budget timeline, it bears repeating in
this summary that this Executive Budget starting point – as robust as it is – is only just that, a starting point, and there is a
long road ahead to seek needed adjustments as well as make full use of funding opportunities in other agency budgets
(such as Economic Development and the Education Department).
We must ensure that we, as a System, stay coherent in communication, interaction, and efforts on behalf of the
SUNY System with Local, State, and Federal officials. We must show that we are appreciative and excited to utilize this
opportunity to meet the challenges of becoming a 21st century educational leader and aid in the re-imagining of SUNY for
this new, New York, and we look forward to engaging with these same Local, State, and Federal officials to see even more
wins and investments in SUNY when the current Executive Budget becomes the Enacted Budget at the end of March.

This $48.8M increase to the State-operated campuses reflects a one-year elimination of the current projected
“TAP Gap” cost to these institutions, allowing the full re-investment of these funds in campus operations. This is a change
from the 21/22 Enacted Budget, which phased this elimination in over a three-year period. In addition, the expected
funding for costs related to Police Benevolent Association of New York State (PBANYS) contract costs are included.
While there is no legislation included in the 22/23 Executive Budget related to a “freeze” on resident
undergraduate rate increases, it can be inferred from the lack of specific language – and the tone in the associated budget
materials – that the halt on these increases following the 21/22 Enacted Budget continues.

Direct Support
 $416.4M: Base Operating Aid (+$3.8M)
 $29.7M: Categorical Programs (+$5.4M for Expansion of Child Care Centers)

The Executive Budget reflects all funding provided in the 2021/22 Enacted Budget for initiatives such as Rental Aid,
Apprentice SUNY, and High Need Programs.
In addition, for the first time, the Executive Budget includes a 100 percent funding floor for the Community
Colleges, equated to the 2021/22 approved Budget Levels, as well as flat per student funding levels at $2,997/FTE student.
Language is also continued to be included allowing for a separate category of tuition rate for high demand
certificate programs. Upon approval by the Chancellor and the SUNY Board of Trustees, this rate may be set lower than
standard rates of tuition and is expected to be leveraged to engage in more competitive enrollment opportunities with
industry and other areas, such as the military. This does not apply universally to all certificate programs.
Finally, like the University-wide Program area, an additional $5.4M has been provided for the expansion of Child
Care offerings.

Legislative Items (in no set order):
Of note, while there is no legislation included in the 22/23 Executive Budget related to a “freeze” on resident
undergraduate rate increases, it can be inferred from the lack of specific language – and the tone in the associated budget
materials – that the halt on these increases following the 21/22 Enacted Budget continues.
The below provides a summary of directly, and indirectly, pertinent legislative changes proposed by the Governor:
-

-

-

-

-

-

Full Elimination of the SUNY “TAP Gap”
o The 21/22 Enacted State Budget included a multi-year plan to eliminate the TAP Gap, with the cost
incurred by the State-operated Campuses being fully eliminated at the end of a four-year period.
o The Governor’s 22/23 Executive proposal would eliminate this waiting period, and instead would fully
eliminate the TAP Gap in the 22/23 year and provide Direct State Tax Support to do so.
Expand the Tuition Assistance Program to Part-Time Students
o Proposes that students taking six-or-more credits at a SUNY, CUNY, or non-proprietary independent
college in approved courses of work would be eligible for a pro-rated TAP award.
o In addition, it would allow for similar part-time TAP awards to be made to community college students
enrolled in eligible workforce credentialling programs, with program eligibility to be determined by the
Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC) and the Regional Economic Development Council (REDC)
following an analysis of pertinent information.
Restore TAP Awards for Incarcerated Individuals
o The Governor proposes to restore this provision, removed from the TAP Program in 1995, which would
allow for incarcerated individuals to be eligible for TAP awards.
Accelerate the Excelsior Scholarship program Tuition Rate Re-Set
o The 21/22 Enacted Budget extended the “re-set” of the “frozen” 16/17 tuition rates charged to recipients
of an Excelsior Scholarship to 23/24 from the planned 21/22.
o The proposed budget would re-set this rate in 22/23 and provide for it to be re-set on an annual basis,
providing an additional revenue stream to institutions.
Allow the Use of College Saving Accounts (529s) for Apprenticeship Programs
o This proposal would expand the qualified uses of 529 accounts to allow them to be used to support the
costs of attending apprenticeship programs.
Cease the Practice of Transcript Withholding
o Proposes that no institutions of postsecondary education in New York State can withhold a student’s
transcripts for outstanding student bills, and puts into place a per instance $500 fine, exposure to private
right of action, as well as potential termination of ability to participate in State funded financial aid
programs if an institution is found in violation.
Streamline new education program approval
o Provides for temporary approval of any curriculum or program of study that does not require master plan
amendment by the Board of Regents and has been approved by the governing body of a public and notfor-profit independent college charted by the Board of Regents and with longstanding accreditation by the
Middle States Commission of Higher Education, pending program approval by SED.
Expanded Income Eligibility for Child Care Subsidies
o Would expand the eligibility for child care subsidies from 200 percent of the federal poverty level, to 300
percent.
Increase the Investment in Veteran’s Service Agencies (VSAs)
o Would increase the minimum allocations to these entities from $10,000 to $25,000, allowing them to aid
veterans in receiving their earned benefits.
Waive the Income Cap for Retired Teachers and School Workers
o Would waive the $35,000 income limit for retirees, incentivizing them to rejoin the school workforce.
o The waiver would end on 6/30/2024.

Nurses Across New York (NANY)
o Would establish the noted NANY program, which would provide loan repayment funding to awarded
nurses serving in low-income communities.
o In addition, it would create a working group to make the application process more streamlined and
efficient.
Interstate Medical Licensure Compact
o Would allow for New York State to join the Interstate Medical Licensure and Nurse Licensure Compact,
which would provide the ability for non-NYS doctors and nurses to relocate to New York State more easily.
Improved Scope of Practice
o Would allow for pharmacist’s to be designated as a qualified healthcare professional for the purposes of
directing a limited-service laboratory for point of care testing.
o Also adjusts certain portions of law related to nursing.
Healthcare Workforce Bonuses
o Would provide for a maximum one-time bonus of up-to $3,000 for health and mental hygiene workers
that earn up-to $100,000 annually.
Various Hospital Related Proposals
o Several proposals are also put forth, establishing a $1.6B Statewide Health Care Facility Transformation
Program IV, make changes to the Medicaid trend factor, modify the Statewide Global Cap, and make Long
Term / Managed Care / Essential Plan, and other reforms.
Poll Places on Campus
o Proposes that local boards of elections are required to establish one-or-more poll sites on college
campuses whenever it contains 300 or more registrants.
Small Business Seed Funding Grant Program
o Proposes a grant program to support early stage, new micro/small businesses in New York State.
The Clean Water, Clean Air, and Green Jobs Act of 2022
o Would establish a $4.0B Clean Water, Clean Air, and Green Jobs bond act to fund related projects.
Creation of a Tax Exemption for Income Related to Loan Forgiveness Awards
o Would exclude income received through a Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC) loan forgiveness
award from the calculation of income.
Creation of a Small Business COVID-19 Related Tax Credit
o Proposes a tax credit for COVID-19 related capital costs incurred by small businesses.
Division of Human Rights (DHR) Amendments
o Extends New York State Human Rights Law protections to victims of domestic violence and to individuals
based on citizenship and immigration status. These protections are extended across multiple areas of the
law, including – as relevant to SUNY – in employment or educational settings. For issues related to
domestic violence, the legislation would not preclude verification of citizenship or immigration status
where required by law.
Transfer regulations of professions from SED to the Department of Health (DOH)
o Transfer oversight and enforcement of licensed medical professions from SED to the New York State DOH.
Ethics for Municipal Officers
o Amends General Municipal Law to specify that municipal officers cannot accept a gift above nominal value
if it gives the appearance of a conflict of interest. It also clarifies the types of family members who cannot
have a contractual interest in businesses impacted by that municipal officer. These provisions of General
Municipal Law have historically been interpreted to include Community College officials.
JCOPE Replacement
o Repeals JCOPE and replaces it with an Independent Commission Ethics. The five members are appointed
by a selection committee of law school deans
X marker on State Agency Forms
o All state agencies that collect demographic data on sex or gender have to provide an option for the person
to select “X.” If federal law requires a binary selection, the agency must create a separate field to select
“X”

Amendment to Share Employment Information with Federal Education Department in Regard to Public Service
Loan Forgiveness Program
o Amends the Personal Privacy Protection Law to authorize agencies to disclose state employee information
with the federal Department of Education to process credit for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness
Program

Capital Budget:
The 22/23 Executive Budget recommends new capital appropriations for:
State-operated Campuses / Statutory Colleges – Educational Facilities
- $425.0M in new flexible capital funding that can be used for new construction, programmatic, or critical
maintenance projects. The appropriation is provided in a lump sum appropriation subject to a plan to be
developed by SUNY and approved by the director of the budget.
o As an offset to this new capital appropriation, the Executive Budget eliminates reappropriations for the
following programs:
 $200M State share for the Strategic Needs Capital Matching Program. Projects for new
engineering buildings at Stony Brook and the University at Buffalo, announced in the Governor’s
State-of-the-State would be funded with a portion of the new $425.0M appropriation.
 Unused NY-SUNY 2020 Challenge Grants that were appropriated within the Empire State
Development Corporation’s capital budget.
- $550.0M in critical maintenance funding for 22/23, the same level as provided in 21/22. The 22/23 Executive FiveYear Capital Program & Financing Plan indicates that this level of funding will continue through 26/27, for a total
of $2,750.0M over five-years.
o Of the $550.0M provided in 22/23, $153.4M is allocated to each State-operated campus and Statutory
College and $396.6M is provided in a lump sum for priority critical maintenance projects. See Attachment
B for campus detail.
 As was done in the past five years, the $396.6M lump sum is to be allocated for high priority
critical maintenance projects, with the highest priority given to projects that address life and
safety concerns, core infrastructure in need of replacement that, if not addressed, could disrupt
campus operations, and upgrade buildings and infrastructure to meet current building codes and
regulations, such as ADA.
o Use of the new appropriation is restricted to critical maintenance projects in existing facilities, although
the language allows for in-kind replacement of smaller accessory and support structures when it is more
economical to rebuild within the existing facility footprint.
o The appropriations for 23/24 and thereafter are not included in the Executive Budget and would be
subject to the approval of the Legislature each year
State-operated Campuses – Residence Halls
- Consistent with SUNY’s capital budget request, $75.0M is provided for the pay-as-you-go portion of the residence
hall program, with an additional $75.0M planned over the next four years, for a five-year total of $375.0M.
Consistent with SUNY’s request, the spending target was increased to $100.0M over the next two years, with an
additional $75M planned over subsequent three years.
Hospitals
- $150.0M in new capital support for projects at each of the three teaching hospitals - Downstate University
Hospital, Upstate University Hospital, and Stony Brook University Hospital, $50.0M for each hospital. Each hospital
would still be required to reimburse the State for the associated debt service. The 22/23 Executive Five-Year
Capital & Financing Plan does not reflect any planned funding in subsequent years.
Community Colleges
- $56.9M as a lump sum appropriation, considered to represent the State’s 50 percent funding share for 69 projects
at 23 community colleges that received local sponsor support. The projects that secured local sponsor support are
listed in Attachment C.

- The capital budget also provides an appropriation of $198.0M to allow for the transfer of operating expenses of
facilities departments at the State-operated campuses. No State support is provided, instead, the State’s expense
is reimbursed by a transfer of cash balances from several SUNY operating accounts.
- Except for the Strategic Needs Capital Matching Program as noted above, the Executive Budget recommends
reauthorization of all prior year appropriations, totaling $3.9B for SUNY’s capital programs, including:
o Educational Facilities
o Hospitals
o Community Colleges
o Residence Halls
