Resolution on a Study of IT Shared Governance
WHEREAS Information Technology (IT) policies have a measurable impact on curriculum
delivery and student learning experiences,
WHEREAS the faculty bears the primary responsibility to deliver the curriculum and facilitate
student learning,
WHEREAS the presence of faculty representatives in IT related committees is necessary but is
not in itself sufficient for meaningful faculty participation in IT policy making processes,
WHEREAS concerns have been expressed that faculty input may not have been effectively
utilized in IT decisions concerning policy, planning, purchasing, maintenance, and operations,
WHEREAS meaningful faculty consultation in IT policy making aligns with two of the 2021
Middle States Self Study Institutional Priorities: 3. Encourage greater mutual understanding,
collaboration, and transparency among campus units through an appreciation and respect for
each other’s contributions towards achieving our shared student-centered goals and furthering
the College Mission, and 4. Strengthen faculty governance and its relationship with the College’s
administration for the benefit of students and the broader institution,
WHEREAS best outcomes in shared governance occur when based on empirical data,

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Faculty Senate will form a taskforce of faculty to
investigate how faculty input has been provided and how this input has impacted IT decisions.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the task force will document evidence of the faculty
experience of IT shared governance through empirical data collection such as 1) interviews with
those who have represented the faculty on IT-related issues and 2) a survey or focus groups with
the broader faculty body, with appropriate institutional assistance,
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the task force will investigate, such as by contacting
faculty governance at other SUNY comprehensive colleges and by researching best practices
promulgated by relevant professional organizations, optimal forms of IT shared governance and
the appropriate role of a college IT Governance Committee,
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the task force will report the outcome to the Faculty
Senate by November 1, 2019.
