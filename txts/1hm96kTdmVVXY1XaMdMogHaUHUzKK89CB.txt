Whereas, The Plan for additional parking indicates the clear cut of trees and increasing of hardscape on
multiple surfaces on drain sensitive recharge land, and does not include a carbon footprint analysis with offset
plan; and
Whereas, the Faculty has not been meaningfully included in the vetting and processes arriving at critical
decisions about the impact of, alternatives to, and siting of The Plan; and,

Whereas, faculty serving in various capacities have requested information about The Plan processes and
decisions and requested more meaningful participation in the steps leading to the Plan; and
Whereas, the NYSDEC requires that all plans for siting of projects weigh the impacts of environment with the
social and financial costs of a project, at least, equally; and,
Whereas, the college’s Mission requires advancing a more environmental sustainability world, and the College
Values state that our engagement in all facets of the development of the college be accomplished via
meaningful participatory governance, transparency, integrity, inclusion so that all processes and projects
undertaken at the college for the development and betterment of the college community follow fully
transparent and fully inclusive processes, with full disclosure and discussion about the best practice processes
and decisions; and,
Whereas, The SUNY Board of Trustees empowers the Faculty on each campus to select and charge their
faculty selected representatives to be meaningfully consulted in all matters affecting their work and delivery
of their services; and,
Whereas, the decision to alter natural land features, to cut trees and to place hardscape on hydrologically and
geologically sensitive lands should be encumbered by Best Practices in technology, science, and governance;

Whereas, the Faculty have been asked to provide input into The Plans as indicated on the maps and
descriptive material and EIS Short Form circulated on March 2, 2018 and for which the Faculty is invited to
respond by March 29, 2018; and,
Whereas, the Faculty have not received any official information, nor been involved in processes for
determining the design of or exclusion from a full SEQR process; and,
Whereas, The Plan raised serious questions and concerns prior to its release which have yet to be resolved,
about processes, data and stakeholder inclusion; also, in its review of the circulated documents, the Executive
Committee finds remaining concerns and questions about transparency, suitability and decision-making
processes; and,
Therefore Be It Resolved, that the Faculty Senate of the State University of New York at Old Westbury
requests that all final decisions for locating and initiating the construction of additional parking spaces on the
campus be deferred until the processes resulting in the decision be evaluated for Best Fit and Best Outcome to
meet the expectations of the College Mission and Values for community engagement, transparency and best
practices of sustainable environmental decisions and operations for the specific and sensitive land to be
affected by The Plan; and,
Be It Further Resolved, that financial transparency is necessary for Best Practice decision-making, and,
Further Resolved, that the Faculty reserves the option to circulate this Preamble, with and without this
Resolution, to SUNY campus units via its Campus Governance Leaders and the SUNY University Faculty Senate
