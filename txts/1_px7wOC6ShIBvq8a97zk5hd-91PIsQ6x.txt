Proposal for Simplification of Transfer Residency Requirement

Submitted by the Academic Practices Committee, 3/24/16

Whereas, the College currently has dual requirements for transfer student residency, one consisting of a credit count, the other of a semester count, and 

Whereas, the stated credit count could be achieved in fewer semesters than currently required and in exceptional cases has been, with waivers granted by the APC, and

Whereas, the semester requirement places unnecessary burdens on highly motivated students who could potentially complete their studies sooner, and 

Whereas, few peer institutions have such dual requirements for transfer student residency, the vast majority having only credit requirements,

Be It Resolved, that we eliminate the semester requirement for transfer residency while upholding the current 40 (or 48 for Accounting) credit requirement by amending the relevant Handbook language as follows:

Residency Requirement

To earn a degree from SUNY College at Old Westbury, students are required to earn a minimum of 40* credits at Old Westbury.
