Proposal for Micro-Credential in Spanish Translation
Department of Modern Languages
A. Purpose
The Micro-Credential in Spanish Translation is designed to help individuals develop
basic skills for translating documents of a professional nature from English into Spanish.
The program is germane to persons interested in careers such as educational services;
business services; health services; communications; local government; social services;
printing and publishing; chemicals and allied products; state government; and federal
Government. Employment in the occupation is expected to increase steadily as most of
these industries expand. The micro-credential program is open to current college students
and individuals seeking to add to their portfolio and make themselves more marketable to
nemployers.
The program consists of four sequential courses, four credits each, for a total of sixteen
credits.
B. Demand
According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in the occupation is
expected to increase steadily as most of these industries expand. A growth rate is
expected to be faster than the average for all occupations.1 In addition to overall growth
in the industries employing interpreters and translators, higher demand is expected to
result from increased international ties and increased numbers of foreign language
speakers in the United States. Both of these trends are expected to continue, according to
data from the World Trade Organization and the U.S. Census Bureau.

C. Resources
Three of the four courses are already being offered as part of Spanish Language, Hispanic
Literature and Culture degree. We need to add an additional course, a Seminar in
Translation Techniques at the 4000 level, which could be offered every year as an
evening section. No additional resources will be needed to support this one additional
1 According to the “Occupational Outlook Handbook” of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
https://www.bls.gov/OOH/media-and-communication/interpreters-and-translators.htm#tab-6,
employment of interpreters and translators is projected to grow 19 percent from 2018 to 2028, much faster than the
average for all occupations. Employment growth reflects increasing globalization and a more diverse U.S. population,
which is expected to require more interpreters and translators. Demand will likely remain strong for translators of
frequently translated languages, such as French, German, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.
Also, see SLATOR, a website on Language Industry Intelligence, metrics and statistics. There are several articles
pertaining to the “Boom” in the US Language Industry: https://slator.com/industry-news/us-language-industry-boomsdoubles-headcount-within-7-years/

section. So to start, only one additional course will be needed to support this microcredential.
D. Cost, Financial Aid
Courses for this micro-credential will be offered at the regular tuition rate. The microcredential is stackable with the Spanish Language, Hispanic Literature and Culture
degree and those majors will be able to utilize financial aid. For students who are not
Spanish Language, Hispanic Literature and Culture majors, micro-credential courses will
be eligible for financial aid if they fall within the college elective component of the
student's degree program (as with a minor). These are regular four credit college
courses and earned credits may be transferred to other SUNY institutions.

E. Title
The name “Fundamentals of Spanish Translation” is not the title of any registered degree
or certificate program.
F. Assessment
The Micro-Credential will be assessed along with the other programs in the Department
of Modern Languages as part of its regular reviews.
G. Additional Materials
