We have roughly 440 students studying in facilities dependent in person classes this
this fall, as compared to 4800 in the preceding fall semester. With 16 faculty
teaching those facility dependent courses, as compared to 375 faculty last fall.
Unlike the other comprehensive colleges in New York State, SUNY Old Westbury
does not have students living on campus this semester so mandatory testing does
look a little different.
We rely on faculty and staff to set an example for students and get tested voluntarily
at no cost to the employee.
Pool surveillance testing is extremely expensive. We have yet to detect a single
positive case in our testing
The college's approved budget for 2019/2020 was $62 million, but only 60 million
was spent because the state withheld 20% of the last quarters funds.
To date, the state has not provided tax support funds to the campuses yet.
So our spending on all funds basis for the current year is about $15 million 31.3 6
million in tuition and broad base fees 7.5 million from revenue generated by special
campus special revenue accounts, and about $11 million from accumulated reserves.
Managing spending is crucial using things such as a hiring freeze.
Schools can expect a 20% loss in funding for this year however We achieved 99.5%
of our headcount goal in terms of enrollment the college.
The college received about $5.5 million in federal Cares Act funding in the spring,
half is earmarked as non-tuition awards to students affected by COVID-19. And the
other half was to be used by the institution to recover expenses related to the
pandemic.
We Received $451,000 in institutional aid for its status as a minority serving
institution. And, and also received student award funding totaling $2.75 million.
Now, the college has awarded approximately $962,000 or 35% of the funds that are
available to direct directly to students.
Students are encouraged to apply for funding that has been allocated to them.
Budget numbers in the report will be distributed to faculty.
