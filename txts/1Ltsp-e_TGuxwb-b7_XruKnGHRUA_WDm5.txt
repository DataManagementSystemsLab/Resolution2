|Seats still remain for a forum exploring higher education and workforce |
|development to be held Tuesday, November 17, 2015, from 4:00-5:30 with a|
|5:30-6:00 p.m. reception to follow at SUNY Global Center, 116 East 55th |
|Street, New York. The program is being hosted by SUNY Chancellor Nancy  |
|L. Zimpher and the Rockefeller Institute of Government. It is free and  |

|Keynoting the event will be Peter Stokes, author of the critically      |
|acclaimed new book, Higher Education and Employability: New Models for  |
|Integrating Study and Work (Harvard Education Press). Stokes makes a    |
|crucial contribution to the reassessment of higher education in the     |
|United States by focusing on how colleges and universities can          |
|collaborate with businesses to serve the educational and professional   |
|interests of their students. Drawing on his extensive experience with   |
|universities and the business world, Stokes argues that the need for    |
|closer alignment between the two sectors has never been more            |
|critical ---- and that the opportunities for partnership have never been|
|greater.                                                                |
