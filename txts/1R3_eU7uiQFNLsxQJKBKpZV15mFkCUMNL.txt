Education in the Nation
180th Plenary, October 18-20, 2018

LOCATION:

RESOLUTION #:

VOTE TALLY:

For: 33; Against: 12; Abstain: 2

RE:

RATIONALE:
WHEREAS the SUNY Board of Trustees passed the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Policy in
2015 stating that “SUNY aspires to be the most inclusive state university system in the country”;
and
WHEREAS the SUNY mission statement clearly states that “The mission of the state university
system shall be to provide to the people of New York educational services of the highest quality,
with the broadest possible access, fully representative of all segments of the population ….”;
and
WHEREAS scores on standardized tests (e.g. SAT, ACT, GRE) are poor predictors of student
success in undergraduate and graduate programs and test scores more closely correlate with
wealth than college readiness; and
WHEREAS the use of standardized tests in admissions has a particularly negative impact on
underrepresented groups’ application and admission rates; and
WHEREAS almost 40% of NYS Public High School graduates are Black or Latinx, yet their
population of the student body in SUNY is only 24% and at Doctoral Degree Granting and
Research Centers they represent less than 20% of the student population; and
(6) WHEREAS Black and Latinx students are more concentrated in our four-year colleges and
the community colleges with less selective admissions, creating a lack of diversity at our
colleges with more selective admissions; and
WHEREAS “ the adoption of a well-executed test-optional admission policy can lead to
an increase in overall applications as well as an increase in the representation of URM
students (both numeric and proportionate) in the applicant pool and the freshman class”1; and
WHEREAS SAT, ACT and GRE tests represent a financial burden for many students in
pursuing degrees:

RESOLUTION:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the SUNY UFS recommends that the SUNY Chancellor
advocate that all SUNY campuses become test free or test optional and that Campus
Governance Leaders and Chief Academic Officers take the necessary steps to eliminate or
make optional standardized test scores as a metric of evaluation for applicants to
undergraduate and graduate programs across SUNY; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED for “standardized test optional campuses” that, unless the
applicant otherwise directs, all admissions decisions be made prior to viewing test scores; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that if standardized test scores are used to evaluate applicants,
campuses should justify their use and admissions criteria should account explicitly for the
known systematics in scores as a function of gender, race, and socioeconomic status, and that
cutoff scores not be used to eliminate candidates from admission or for eligibility to receive
SUNY-wide, State-sponsored, and campus-based scholarships/fellowships and financial
support.
