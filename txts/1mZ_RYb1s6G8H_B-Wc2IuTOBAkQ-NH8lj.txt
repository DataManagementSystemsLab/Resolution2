Meetings
Three committee meetings were held during the year; one in Fall 2013 and two in Spring
2014. Members attended only one of the two meetings in the spring semester.
Fall Meeting – Sept 11 & 12, 2013
Meetings were conducted by current co-Chair Lillian Park and former co-Chair Ryoko
Yamamoto. Ryoko Yamamoto finished her term as co-Chair in May 2013, but she helped
to conduct the initial fall meeting to solicit nominations for a new co-Chair. New
members were welcomed to the Committee. Lillian and Ryoko explained the purpose of
the committee and reviewed the judicial hearing process for the new members.
Nominations for a new co-Chair were taken at the meeting. Members could nominate
other candidates at the meeting or via email for a one-week period. Nominations were

closed on Sept 19th and an online election was held. James Fornaro was elected to be coChair for the 2013-2015 academic year period. Lillian Park was finishing her second year
of her term (2012-2014).
Shortly after the first meeting, Brian Schwirzbin requested committee members to submit
their availability for hearings that might take place during the coming semester. Each
member was then provided with a formal schedule indicating time-slots where attendance
at hearings was expected.
Special Conduct Board for OCR Title IX Violations
New interested volunteers from the Faculty Judicial Committee completed additional
training that would qualify them to sit on hearings related to sexual assault, sexual
harassment, and rape.
Spring Meetings on Bylaw Reviews Feb 24 & 25, 2014
On December 6, 2013 Lillian Park and James Fornaro received an email from Duncan
Quarless, President of Faculty Senate, to conduct a bylaw review for the Faculty Judicial
Committee. In particular, the committee was asked to address three key issues:
(1) Leadership structure as prescribed by bylaws as compared with the practice activity of
the committee;
(2) The functional aspects of the committee as related to the members (that includes any
ex-officio contributors);
(3) The nature of the charge as compared to the actual practice/operation of the
committee
Lillian Park and James Fornaro distributed the materials (bylaw amendments and
description of FJC) to all members in January. Drs. Park and Fornaro drafted and
distributed an initial summary statement in early February. Two meetings were held in
late February with committee members to discuss the bylaws and the summary statement.
The summary statement was revised after consultations with committee members. On
March 14, 2014, the final summary statement and report was sent to Dr. Duncan Quarless
and Faculty Senate.
Assessment
For the 2013-2014 academic year, there were a total of 240 reported incidents of
misconduct (involving 591 students), which resulted in 30 College Judicial Board
Hearings. Out of the 20 faculty members, 19 served on at least one hearing during the
academic year. More specifically, from Summer 2013 to Fall 2013, there were 126
reported incidents of misconduct, which resulted in 13 College Judicial Board Hearings.
Thirteen faculty Judicial Board members served on these hearings. In Spring 2014, there
were 114 reported incidents of misconduct, which resulted in 17 hearings. Thirteen
faculty Judicial Board members served on these hearings.

The 2013-2014 number of reported incidents of misconduct (240) is comparable to the
previous 2012-2013 academic year’s number of reported incidents of misconduct (243).
Moreover, the total number of students involved during 2013-2014 (591) is relatively
comparable to the number of students involved during 2012-2013 (550). A significant
difference from the previous academic year is the number of College Judicial Board
Hearings. There were 23 College Judicial Board hearings during 2012-2013. The number
of hearings increased to 30 for 2013-2014. A further review did not attribute this increase
to any particular factor(s).
The number of hearings that the faculty members served on for the 2013-2014 academic
year was more equitably distributed, though no changes have been made to how faculty
members are assigned to hearings. The greater number of hearings in 2013-2014 gave
more faculty members a chance to serve on at least one hearing.
