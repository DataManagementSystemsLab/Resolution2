Section 2. Program Summary
In 300 or fewer words, describe the proposed program, including its purpose, content, structure and duration.

The undergraduate degree in Women’s, Gender, & Sexuality Studies will provide students with an
interdisciplinary program that examines the creation, reconstruction, and perpetuation of asymmetrical
gender, sex, and sexuality systems and their connections to other operations of power and inequities.
Explorations of how gender, sex, and sexuality intersect with race, ethnicity, and class will be extended to
the imperial and globalizing contexts shaping these systems of power.
Considering historical, contemporary, and transnational perspectives, the program investigates and critiques
how ideologies of gender, sex, and sexuality have influenced and been influenced by social and cultural
systems; literature and the arts; economic and political systems; law and public policy; and health, medicine,
science, and technology. The program’s critical, intersectional lens closes gaps in traditional higher
education resulting from the historic exclusion of marginalized groups from many fields of study.
Aligned with SUNY OW’s mission, this program engages with social justice, empowering students through
intersectional feminist and queer theories, research, and methodologies. This program enables students to
think critically about how social, cultural and institutional structures shape their own lives, and how their
active social and political engagement can dismantle oppressive structures.
In this 120 credit degree, students take three core courses (12 credits): Introduction to Women’s, Gender,
and Sexuality Studies (WGSS); Feminisms: Gender, Sexuality, and Power; and a Practicum. Introduction to
WGSS and Feminist Theories and Methods provide a grounding in feminist theory, research, and activism.
The Practicum serves as an applied learning experience for majors in the junior or senior year. Students
must also select an additional 28 credits from a series of electives organized around the following
interdisciplinary categories: Historical and Political Contexts, Cultural Productions and Representations, and
Intersectionality. Students must take a course in each of the three categories; four must be upper-division
courses.

Optional, Illustrative Questions to Consider:
For other SUNY campuses responding to the Program Announcement
● Do you have a similar or related program? ●What has been your experience with the program? ●Would the
introduction of this program have any effect, positive or negative, on your institution? If so, please specify. ●Do you
perceive a need for this kind of program? ●Does the program offer an opportunity for articulation or inter-institutional
cooperation?
Your response must be in writing, from your President, and addressed to the President of the proposing campus,
with a copy to the SUNY Provost at program.review@.suny.edu.
Procedure for Program Announcements (PA)
1. SCOPE. A SUNY campus must send a PA to the SUNY Provost at program.review@suny.edu before submitting
a proposal for a new program leading to an undergraduate degree. Unless requested by the SUNY Provost, a PA
is not required for a program leading to an undergraduate certificate, for a new program being created by
combining existing registered programs (e.g., multi-award programs and/or multi-institution programs), or for a
new program being created from a track, specialization, or concentration in a registered program.
2. SUNY PROVOST’S REVIEW. The SUNY Provost’s Office reviews each PA for accuracy and completeness as
well as for substantive issues, such as alignment with campus mission and SUNY policy, and requests changes
when needed.
3. PUBLICATION FOR COMMENTS. Once a PA is acceptable to the SUNY Provost, it is announced on the
SUNY Program Review listserv in a weekly Program Review Update, which starts a 30-day intra-SUNY
comment period. The listserv includes all campus presidents, chief academic officers, and others upon request.
The PA enables other SUNY campuses – particularly those with experience with related programs – to provide
information to the proposing campus that can be used to construct a sound program proposal.
4. COMMENTS FROM OTHER CAMPUSES. The President of each interested campus must send comments
within 30 days of a PA’s publication in the Program Review Update to the President of the proposing campus,
with a copy to the Provost at program.review@suny.edu. Comments may include advice and suggestions about
possible articulation opportunities, enrollment trends in related programs, and opportunities for cooperation, as
well as concerns or objections.
5. FOLLOWING THE COMMENT PERIOD. Once the 30-day comment period for a PA ends, and any concerns
and/or objections have been resolved, the campus may prepare a full proposal for the SUNY Provost and, when
required, begin the external evaluation process.
6. EXPIRATION. A PA expires one year after its publication in the Program Review Update. If the proposing
campus does not submit a program proposal to the SUNY Provost before a PA expires, the campus must submit
another PA to start the process again.
