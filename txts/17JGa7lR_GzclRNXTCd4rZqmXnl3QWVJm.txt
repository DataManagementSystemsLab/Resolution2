SUBJECT:

Short Environmental Assessment Form (SEAF)
Regarding the Parking Lot Project

Dear Mr. Mattson:
As Chair of the Faculty Senate and acknowledging the important voice of faculty governance concerning the
activities of the State University of New York at Old Westbury, I am informing you of a comment period
ending March 29, 2018, regarding the SEAF submitted by the State University Fund (SUCF) consultant M.J.
Engineering, in compliance with the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA). Please note that
there was a negative or “no declaration” finding for our parking lot project which means the project was
determined to have no significant adverse environmental impacts.
The completed form has been issued to NYS Department of Environmental Conservation, the Village of Old
Westbury, The State University Construction Fund and the State University of New York at Old Westbury.
Work on site to complete the parking lot will commence after the comment period barring any further
consideration be made or resubmission of the SEAF.
As our campus grows, so is the need to expand and renovate our buildings, physical plant and parking
areas. Our Office of Capital Planning is committed to planning and implementing major improvements that
give us the capacity for continued growth and academic excellence. With the rapid and tremendous
increase in enrollment this past year, the need to expand the number of parking spaces to meet the
increased demand became obvious.
We have successfully accelerated plans to increase the number of parking spaces for the Fall 2018. Site
construction work to enlarge our parking footprint is about to start. The initial phase will add at least 150
new parking spaces. Work will begin with the Student Union parking lot behind the University Police
Building, which will be expanded southward in the direction of Clark Athletic Center. Scheduling of work
beyond the initial phase has yet to be determined. Please note that the SEAF as submitted takes into
account the entire project, not just the initial work and therefore if accepted by the agencies in receipt, will
not be submitted again for each subsequent phase.
