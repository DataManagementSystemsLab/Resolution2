III.

Chair’s Report
●

Welcome President Sams! Thank you for engaging with faculty governance.

●

The Cr/NC resolution and the Innovation Labs were both examples of great
collaboration efforts between various crucial bodies on campus. Congratulations
to the committees, and to our campus for generating good policies and moving in
a collaborative direction for our campus.

●

We want to continue to collaborate with President Sams on Bylaws revisions
including SPAAR and RABPC. We have teams drafting language to create a
functional budget committee. We look forward to great collaboration and
substantive discussions in strategic planning and budgeting. We are also
revisiting the Consultation Clause. We have challenges ahead with enrollment
on our campus. Faculty should get involved since we have great knowledge
about our programs, speak to your Department Chairs regarding enrollment
initiatives. Regarding the Consultation Clause, it is clarified as a point of
information that it does exist in the Bylaws already. Suffice it to say we are
revisiting it.

●

UFS Plenary has a specific meeting for CGL (campus governance leaders)
across SUNY campuses. There are many challenges, but we are doing a great
job of weathering the storm. Much credit is due to both faculty and
administration. Main themes included transitioning back to in-person instruction
and corresponding challenges.

●

For ARPT there has been a transition to the Interfolio system so that the process
is now entirely electronic. Congratulations to everyone who made this happen
including Academic Affairs and ARPT. As we emerge from this difficult time, we
will come out stronger. This is a great example.
Vaccine rollout is encouraging. This is great. Remember to make your
appointments, for all those over 65.

●
●

IV.

The minutes are not available at this time. The Executive Committee apologizes;
they will be available at the next Faculty Senate meeting.

Join the after-party for a more informal discussion. The Chair’s new dog is very
cute. :)

President’s Report
●

Welcome to everyone from President Sams, as he joins from Houston. Great to
see so many increasingly familiar faces. This will not be a traditional President’s

Report since he has only been here for 3 weeks, but Pres. Sams wishes to talk
about vision.

V.

●

The SWOT analysis gives good insight to challenges moving forward. For the
next few months Pres. Sams will listen and learn. Of course, he will have a
vision, but he will also learn about everyone on campus. He wants to be a
responsible, meaningful, and engaged President. He spoke with folks from the
School of Education earlier today.

●

We need to pay attention to enrollment, raising funds, space on campus, building
community and breaking down silos, becoming an employer of choice, feeling
respected, supporting faculty, retaining faculty, and remaining a mission-driven
institution. Our mission is our north star. We will pay attention to our brand. We
are a hidden gem, but we should not be hidden, we should be a gem that
everyone knows about. We should not be sitting on potential we should be
realizing potential. Signature programs are crucial to demonstrate our value as
well as undergraduate research to open up opportunities to students after
graduation. We want to receive magnificent post-grad talent who align with our
mission. Pres. Sams loves the residential college model.

●

The makeup of the cabinet is different under Pres. Sams now, and this
represents the values of the campus. Leadership is core to excellence.
Excellence should be the first thing that comes to mind with our campus.
Academics leads our institution. We have changed the makeup of our cabinet.

●

Pres. Sams wants to hear from everyone, thanks to all. Contact Colleen Woods
for scheduling to meet and talk with Pres. Sams. Pres. Sams congratulates
faculty Rahwa Haile on BLM work. This is one of many things that has convinced
him he has come to the right campus. Pres. Sams is excited to be here, and he
is excited about the mission of the campus! We have so much talent, but many
don’t know about us.

Provost’s Report
●

Thanks to Pres. Sams and FS Chair Kavic. Having a new leadership model is
exciting.

●

We added close to 100 additional students in the add-drop period. This can be
disruptive, thanks to faculty for their cooperation. Use academic support to
connect with these students. Enrollment is still down about 280 students, but
compared to where we were a few weeks ago it was double this number and
even greater at the end of last semester.

●

Faculty diversity plan is implemented by PRODiG initiative. We want to close the
gap between the diversity of the student body and the diversity of faculty. We
have 3 new PRODiG-eligible faculty. We will update regarding faculty diversity
again soon at the next FS meeting. There is a PRODiG fellowship program that
targets postdocs and also students across all disciplines. There is also an NIH
program. There is a rolling application process. There was an ad in the
Chronicle, make sure colleagues apply.

VI.

●

Assoc. Provost Hillery reminds us all that students should fill out the form for
technology assistance including laptop loaners, see “student device request
form” in the portal. Feel free to also email Barbara Hillery directly. From the
laptops loaned last year, 36 requested renewal. Those who are not registered
this semester will not be able to renew. There are 52 new laptop request forms.
We have not had to deny students. Encourage students to reach out.

●

Assistant Dean Notaro speaks regarding Wellness Week. On Monday the library
will be available for commons or study rooms. Students will use Navigate to
make appointments to match occupancy limits. Students will be notified, also
see webpage where instructions are available. Of course, students need to
follow Covid testing rules. Email Cris with questions.

●

Asst. VP of Academic Affairs Barbera speaks regarding Middle States. This
week we will send the self-study report. Thanks to everyone who submitted
comments on the self-study. Dr. Sams is also involved in the process. Those on
the steering committee please send your votes. March 21-24 we will have a
Middle States virtual visit. Between now and then they will ask us questions,
expect to be contacted before the visit regarding questions from Middle States as
needed. We look forward to a positive result.

UFS Report
●

The plenary was virtual and focused on Covid. Concerns included moving back
to in-person instruction in fall and spring as well as testing requirements. UUP is
involved with these questions. Students are mostly not contracting the virus in
classes with one known exception. We are doing well since we don’t have
students on campus. Students may contract off campus. We want to move to
100% testing. We don’t know about the fall semester.

●

Regarding the budget, this situation is seemingly just as bad as last year. There
are no proposed cuts to EOP, Excelsior, Executive Budget. Furlows of faculty is
last resort. Our raises are delayed until 2022-2023. The final budget from the
state legislature will be available in June.

●

The new Chancellor was positive and cooperative. He does not seem as
invested in the SUNY Online Initiative. He says we should learn lessons from our
remote teaching, but the online initiative may or may not expand. He seems
open to increasing enrollment no matter what the medium. We can
accommodate students in a variety of contexts

●

A UFS resolution supported our negotiation with Elsevier, and so they negotiated
more with us in the deal. The SUNY library used analytics to see what journals
we were using. Many were available via open access. If we had to leave our
relationship with Elsevier we would be okay, so this also gave us more
negotiating power. We now have a new contract. A resolution can have an
impact, and it did in this instance.

●

There was discussion on number of contact hours and definitions regarding
contact hours. The Chancellor will work with our campus.

VII.

VIII.

●

There will be no early retirement incentives, but these decisions are also
determined locally on each campus.

●

The UFS resolutions are available with the document meetings (see link above).
The resolutions included: shared governance, consultation in priority areas of
safety and fiscal crisis, Black Lives Matter and anti-racism, eliminating white
supremacy. In future there may be a resolution regarding the events in D.C. on
Jan 6th.

UUP Report
●

UUP President Livingston reports that we are in court regarding the salary raises.
When they are finally put into effect they will be retroactive. If you are not
teaching 6 credits (or equivalent) then faculty are losing health care benefits.
This is a problem for labs in sciences. UUP will address these issues. UUP is
fighting for taxes on wealthy including non-residents living in luxury homes who
pay no taxes. UUP is fighting to reinstate the stock transfer tax. Look for links to
participate including virtual events. Talk to your local legislatures.

●

Please fill out the ballot forms! It is required to be on-paper because a signature
is required. People who are nominated must confirm that they accept a
nomination. You can self-nominate to attend NYSUT representative assembly as
a delegate.

●

UUP is eager to meet with Pres. Sams. It is mandated that the President attend
a meeting with UUP.

●

Next membership meeting next Wed 1pm, announcement to follow.

●

TLRC and UUP will hold To Tenure And Beyond workshop Wed Feb 12th at
1pm. It is exciting that we are now transitioning away from paper binders to
using Interfolio.

SGA Report
●

Apologies to the Old Westbury community for going to the press. SGA President
Metellus loves Old Westbury and cares about our campus. SGA elections are
coming up. SGA is also working on increasing student clubs. SGA has many
awards for various areas. SGA has worked with students for access to wifi and
technology assistance. Remember there is a form for students to fill out on the
student portal, the wifi request form is in the same place as the laptop request
form. The Student Emergency Fund has money, there is an application process
through Scholarship America. Information will be available on the website soon.

●

SGA is recording an awards show, contact them with talents. There will be 7
performances, presenters, and a host. There will be a drive-in movie night, stay
tuned.

●

SGA VP Ogunlade comments on requiring students to turn on cameras during
class time. Students take class from their rooms, their cars, their living rooms.
Students do not think that teaching to black screens is a good enough reason to
require cameras on. Cameras being on is irrelevant, and some faculty are
passive-aggressive regarding this topic. Professors should be focused on
teaching, not focusing on seeing student’s faces. FS Chair comments that this
issue is being referred to the APPC. FS Chair commends SGA for voicing their
concerns, and thanks SGA for coming to faculty with their concerns. Faculty
comments that students should communicate with their Professors regarding
exceptions. Faculty comments that they are working with students one-on-one
based on their personal situations. We should focus on respectful
communication. FS Chair reassures that we will return to this issue, but we need
to move the meeting along.

Unanimous consent is granted to allow the meeting to run until 2:50pm.
IX.

Cr/NC Resolution
●

This was a collaboration between students, APPC, the Executive Committee, the
Registrar, and Academic Affairs. J. D’Ambroise presents the resolution. This is
not an emergency procedure, it is a permanent solution. Due to Covid we are
reevaluating policies. Students and faculty need more time to track progress,
and aligning the deadlines for Cr/NC and Withdrawal would streamline the policy.
Cr/NC requires instructor permission while Withdrawal does not. Simply aligning
the deadline dates is the major proposal here.

●

Will this create extra workload for the Registar? See resolution statement, the
resolution states aligning the dates will streamline workload for the Registrar.

●

The vote will be held online so Senators will have time to consult with their
departments.

●

Faculty asks why do we need instructor approval? When there was not instructor
approval some students did not understand Cr/NC would not count for major
courses. Students should be well-informed before making Cr/NC decisions.
Note that the faculty permission has actually not changed here, the resolution is
simply aligning the deadlines.

●

Faculty asks whether Cr/NC affects financial aid? Yes, if they get credit students
may retain financial aid without affecting GPA. Keep in mind that financial aid is
a complicated question and this may not be a blanket statement.

●

Faculty asks whether the 7th week deadline is optimal, since this is before
midterm grades? This is a separate issue (among others). APPC will separately
consider changing the deadline. This resolution is only regarding aligning the
dates. The actual date being at the 7th week may be reconsidered later.

●

Faculty asks whether students are limited in the total number of Cr/NC they can
do? Again, this is a separate issue that will be considered by APPC.

X.

●

Student comments that many classes do not necessarily get work within the first
three weeks, so three weeks is not enough time to track their progress. It is also
not enough time to consult with departments. Students should have the ability to
opt in and be informed. Students support moving the date from the 3rd to the 7th
week.

●

The vote will be electronic. See forthcoming email for deadline info.

TLRC Resolution
●

XI.

Amended senate meeting schedule
●

XII.

XIII.

E. Hagan presents the resolution. The Be-It-Resolved statement is read aloud.
Please see attached meeting documents (link above). The resolution is accepted
and will be discussed at the next meeting.

The schedule called for 3 meetings in 3 weeks, so we would prefer to adopt the
proposed new schedule making the meetings every two weeks. The new
schedule is confirmed by unanimous vote.

Sharing of Concerns/Announcements
●

Nominations for Chancellors Awards in various areas are due Feb 16th. The
on-campus deadline was Jan 15th, and is now closed. The awards are being
packaged for the President, and the Feb. deadline is the SUNY deadline.

●

The CIRC committee will have a meeting, you will receive an email soliciting
proposals.

●
