From:

Shadi Shahedipour-Sandvik, Provost-in-Charge

Subject: Campus Review of draft Implementation Guidance for SUNY General Education
To:

SUNY Chief Academic Officers

Attached please find preliminary draft Implementation Guidance for SUNY General Education for
campus review and comment. This draft guidance addresses many of the questions and
suggestions we received during the previous comment period on the General Education Advisory
Committee’s (GEAC) initial report and recommendations.
Campus feedback on this preliminary draft implementation guidance—including the draft guidance
for each category of Knowledge and Skills, and Core Competencies (see Appendix I)—is critical as
we work together to prepare for Phase III Implementation of revised SUNY General Education
policy. To that end, and to help facilitate timely and representative feedback through local shared
governance, I am asking each Chief Academic Officer to coordinate a single response for their
campus. Importantly, campus feedback will help shape the Memorandum to Presidents (MTP) that
will follow the SUNY Board of Trustees’ formal consideration of the SUNY General Education
Framework later this fall.
Chief Academic Officers should submit their campus’ feedback to Provost@suny.edu by October
8, 2021.

Implementation Guidance SUNY General Education
(Draft 9-8-2021)

Implementation Guidance for SUNY General Education (Draft 9/8/2021)
A. SUNY General Education Framework and Campus General Education Program(s).
A campus shall have one or more general education program(s) consistent with the requirements of the
SUNY General Education Framework (see Appendix I. SUNY General Education Framework). Each such
program shall enable graduates of SUNY undergraduate degree programs to meet the required SUNY-GE
Framework knowledge and skills areas, and core competencies.
i. SUNY-GE courses. Campuses shall be responsible for reviewing and approving SUNY General
Education courses. 1 SUNY System Administration will provide implementation guidance and
support, including maintaining the University’s database of approved SUNY-GE courses, both current
and historic, but will no longer review individual campus courses for approval. Each campus shall
have a faculty review process for adding, deactivating, or revising SUNY-GE courses and updating
their official list of approved SUNY-GE courses. Each such course shall be aligned with the SUNY-GE
Framework student learning outcomes for the SUNY-GE category (or categories).
ii. Syllabi for SUNY-GE courses. In keeping with good practice and the expectations of the Middle
States Commission on Higher Education and SUNY, the campus will ensure syllabi for SUNY-GE
courses make clear the SUNY-GE student learning outcomes are covered.
iii. Lower-division Courses. In both associate- and baccalaureate-degree programs, SUNY General
Education helps prepare students for upper-division study across the liberal arts and in the major.
Consistent with SUNY’s commitment to seamless transfer and student completion and success, the
campus must ensure that students are able to complete the SUNY-GE requirements within the first
60 credits of all associate- and baccalaureate-degree programs.
iv. Advanced or Upper-division Courses. To promote seamless transfer and timely degree completion,
the campus is encouraged to complement and build on student academic preparation and prior
learning by offering courses that further enrich knowledge and exercise skills. Such courses that
achieve the relevant student learning outcomes may help students who transfer from non-SUNY
institutions.
v. Review of Undergraduate Degree Programs. The campus shall review all undergraduate degree
programs, to determine consistency with the SUNY-GE Framework and revise programs accordingly.
vi. Student Waivers or Equivalencies. Where appropriate, in accordance with SUNY-wide and local
campus academic policies, the campus shall afford students opportunity to obtain a waiver or
equivalency for a SUNY-GE area by demonstrating college-level proficiency in the student learning
outcomes for that area. Waivers may also be granted as a reasonable accommodation for a learning
or other disability.
vii. Programmatic Waivers. The campus may seek a waiver of the minimum number SUNY-GE
knowledge and skills areas (as specified in section B below) and/or maximum credits of a degreelevel for a specific academic program in cases where the program’s curriculum is governed by
external standards such as specialized accreditation. Note: The required areas of Communication—
1
Once approved, SUNY-GE courses shall not be removed from the database of approved SUNY-GE courses, unless
the student learning outcomes have changed and the course no longer meets the category for which it was
approved and/or the course is no longer offered. In such cases, the course must remain on the list of approved
SUNY-GE courses for historical record, so that students who have completed the course in the past will continue to
get credit for the category.

2

Implementation Guidance SUNY General Education
(Draft 9-8-2021)
Written and Oral, Mathematics (and Quantitative Reasoning), and Diversity: Equity, Inclusion, and
Social Justice may not be waived. The campus may approve LAS courses outside the natural sciences
(e.g., in social sciences) in lieu of the Natural Sciences required category, as long as the student
learning outcomes include demonstrating scientific reasoning applied to the respective disciplinary
area(s).
viii. Information for Students. The campus shall provide information to prospective and enrolled
students about SUNY GE, and local and programmatic general education requirements through its
catalog, website, advisement and other means. The information shall be clear, accurate, complete,
current and easy to find. The Office of the Provost will work with campuses to help make
information about general education requirements accessible to students and their advisors. (Note:
The updated SUNY GE is effective for new first-year undergraduate students entering the University
in fall 2023.)
ix. Assessment of the General Education curriculum. The campus shall have a process that meets the
standards of the Middle States Commission on Higher Education for assessing student learning
outcomes in their general education program, and for using assessment results to improve teaching
and learning.
B. SUNY General Education Credit and Category Requirements.
The SUNY General Education framework is foundational in nature and relevant to every student seeking
a SUNY undergraduate degree, while being consistent with institutional accreditation requirements 2 and
applicable New York State Education Department curriculum expectations. 3
In both associate- and baccalaureate-degree programs, SUNY General Education helps prepare students
for upper-division study across the liberal arts and sciences as well as requirements in the major.
Consistent with SUNY’s commitment to seamless transfer and student completion and success,
campuses must ensure that students can complete the SUNY-GE requirements within the first 60 credits
of all undergraduate-degree programs, as specified below:
For AA-, AS-, and baccalaureate-degree programs, the following credit and category requirements apply:
•
•
•

At least 30 credits of SUNY GE-approved Liberal Arts and Sciences
A minimum of seven (of ten) Knowledge and Skills Areas, including the four specifically required
The two core competencies

Consistent with SUNY’s commitment to establish a strong foundation for every SUNY student seeking an
undergraduate degree, along with institutional accreditation expectations and NYSED degree
requirements, the campus’ required general education program also must be included in AAS degrees.
For AAS-degree programs, the following credit and category requirements apply:
•
•
•

At least 20 credits of SUNY GE-approved Liberal Arts and Sciences
A minimum of the four (of ten) specifically required Knowledge and Skills Areas
The two core competencies

Students in AOS-degree programs must also meet the campus general education program’s required
knowledge, skills, and competencies. Whether accomplished by designating freestanding SUNY GEapproved liberal arts and sciences courses and/or embedding required general education content into

applied courses, curriculum mapping will help ensure the institution can demonstrate where required
general education instruction is taking place and assessed.
For AOS-degree programs, the following credit and category requirements apply:
•
•
•

A minimum of zero credits of SUNY GE-approved Liberal Arts and Sciences; more LAS credits
may be added but none are required
A minimum of the four (of ten) specifically required SUNY GE Knowledge and Skills Areas
(freestanding or embedded)

See Appendix II. NYSED, Current SUNY GER, and SUNY General Education Framework – Required LAS
Credits, Minimum Knowledge and Skills, and Core Competencies for a summary comparison.
C. Seamless Transfer. One of the goals of the SUNY General Education Framework is to support
seamless transfer of students between and among SUNY institutions; it ensures consistency in expected
learning outcomes while enabling individual campuses to develop unique signature features, including
their respective array of educational offerings and pedagogical approaches. Consistent with the Policy
and Guidance: Seamless Transfer Requirements (see Memorandum to Presidents, Vol. 13, No. 3):
i. Local general education requirements beyond the SUNY-GE shall not require a transfer student to
exceed the number of credits to graduation required of native students in the same program
(Vol.13, No. 3; I.A.vi.).
ii. If a SUNY sending institution certifies that a student has completed SUNY-GE, then the receiving
institution must accept that requirement as being met (Vol.13, No. 3; I.A.vii.).
iii. If a SUNY sending institution certifies that a student has completed a SUNY-GE knowledge and skills
area, then the receiving institution must accept that requirement as being met. If the transfer
student has completed SUNY-GE areas that are different from the SUNY-GE areas required by the
receiving institution, the receiving institution may require the transfer student to fulfill the
additional general education areas as long as it does not require the transfer student to exceed the
number of credits to graduation that are required of students who began their college education at
the same institution (Vol.13, No. 3; I.A.viii.).
iv. Each SUNY campus will accept credit from transfer students for successfully completing SUNY-GE
Framework courses (Vol.13, No. 3; III.B.).
v. A passing grade counts as successful completion for the SUNY- GE area at any campus; transfer of
credit is guaranteed if a course is successfully completed with a grade of C or above. Each campus
has discretion about whether a particular course grade satisfies local graduation requirements
outside SUNY-GE, provided that the campus treats native and transfer students the same (Vol.13,
No. 3; III.B.i.).
vi. Pass/Fail courses may be accepted at the discretion of the campus, but transfer is not guaranteed
(Vol.13, No. 3; III.B.ii.).
vii. The Chief Academic Officer at each campus will be responsible for ensuring local compliance with
Seamless Transfer Requirements (Vol.13, No. 3; V.B.i.), which includes the transfer of general
education courses.
viii. General Education Transcript Addendum. A sending campus shall provide a General Education
Transcript Addendum (GETA) for each transferring student, and a receiving campus shall accept the
4

Implementation Guidance SUNY General Education
(Draft 9-8-2021)
GETA as certification of completed SUNY-GE (Vol. 10, No.1; II.D.iv.). Methods of transcripting
courses may be periodically reviewed and revised, in consultation with SUNY stakeholders, in order
to remain current with advances in technology.
GENERAL GUIDANCE Q & A FOR CAMPUS IMPLEMENTATION
1. What is the anticipated timeline for full implementation?
It is anticipated the SUNY Board of Trustees will consider the SUNY General Education Framework in
fall 2021; guidance issued early winter 2022; full implementation for new students fall 2023.
2. Will System Administration continue to review and approve proposed SUNY-GE courses?
No, the campus will be responsible for reviewing and approving proposed SUNY-GE courses. System
will provide support, as needed.
3. Will the CourSES application be updated?
SUNY will work with the Office of Institutional Research and campus stakeholders to streamline
campus reporting of campus-approved SUNY general education courses. The CourSES application will
sunset once the revised reporting infrastructure is in place.
4. Do courses approved by the campus for competencies count toward the SUNY-GE credit
requirements?
No, not unless the course(s) also satisfy the learning outcomes in one or more knowledge and skills
area(s). The campus faculty will determine whether a given course addresses SUNY-GE knowledge and
skills, along with core competencies. For infused competencies not tied to specific courses, campus
faculty must demonstrate that the learning outcomes are satisfied in the overall GE program.
5. How many categories may be met by a single course?
Campus faculty will determine whether courses satisfy student learning outcomes in multiple
categories; the campus is encouraged to ensure sufficient breadth in their general education
program(s).
6. Will the General Education Transfer Addendum (GETA) be revised?
Yes, System Administration will work with the SUNY Registrars on adjustments to the GETA.
7. Can a student satisfy a category via PLA?
Yes, a student may satisfy the requirements of a category through Prior Learning Assessment (aka
Credit by Evaluation); campus faculty will make such determinations; the transcript and GETA will
reflect the credits and category(ies) satisfied.
8. If a category is waived, does the student still have to earn the SUNY-GE minimum credits but just in
any area?
Individual student waivers are at the discretion of the campus CAO or designee, and the reasons
should be documented. In general, students will need to satisfy minimum SUNY GE-approved credit
and category requirements. The campus may request program waivers for SUNY Provost review and
approval.
9. What is the threshold for demonstrating knowledge, skills, and competencies?
All student learning outcomes for a category must be achieved to satisfy the category. Campus faculty
will determine in their courses how students demonstrate the required learning outcomes for each
category.
5

Implementation Guidance SUNY General Education
(Draft 9-8-2021)
10. What is the content threshold for courses to be considered in a specific category?
All student learning outcomes for a category must be achieved to satisfy the category. Campus faculty
will determine in their courses how best to meet the required student learning outcomes for each
category.
11. Can a campus remove an approved SUNY-GE course? If so, how?
Once approved, SUNY-GE courses shall not be removed from the database of approved SUNY-GE
courses, unless the student learning outcomes have changed and the course no longer meets the
category for which it was approved and/or the course is no longer offered. In such cases, the course
must remain on the list of approved SUNY-GE courses for historical record, so that students who have
completed the course in the past will continue to get credit for the category
12. Does SUNY policy guarantee transfer of SUNY-GE courses?
Yes, SUNY policy guarantees transfer of SUNY General Education courses with a grade of C or better.
The campus will document satisfaction of student learning outcomes/categories on the GETA.
13. Are higher-level courses in the same discipline for which a SUNY-GE approved course as a prerequisite approvable for SUNY GE?
Yes, typically courses in the discipline for which an approved SUNY-GE course is a prerequisite are
approvable in that category as well. Campus faculty will determine SUNY-GE approvability,
recognizing that students must be able to complete SUNY-GE requirements within the first 60 credits.
14. What about the MSCHE-specified requirement for Technological Competency?
Because disciplines vary in terms of the technologies needed to support their scholarly, creative, and
applied endeavors, campus faculty can best determine what constitutes technological competency in
their respective disciplinary area and design curricula accordingly.
15. Can campuses go beyond the student learning outcomes specified in each SUNY-GE category?
Yes, as noted in the SUNY General Education Framework document, the student learning outcomes
for each of the categories are intentionally broad, to ensure seamless transfer as well as faculty
flexibility. Campus faculty are encouraged to engage with the learning outcomes and develop
language appropriate to the level of challenge to students warranted by the discipline and level of
study. Faculty may find Bloom’s Taxonomy and its subsequent revision (see
https://www.bloomstaxonomy.net/) helpful in this regard.

APPENDIX I. SUNY GENERAL EDUCATION FRAMEWORK
SUNY GENERAL EDUCATION VISION STATEMENT
The State University of New York’s overarching goal is to empower students to meet the changing
demands of the 21st-century. Embedded in this goal are SUNY’s commitment to broad access to the
highest quality education, deep and engaged learning, and overall student success.
SUNY General Education supports these goals by creating a system-wide framework—applicable to all
SUNY undergraduate degree programs—that addresses the fundamental aims of postsecondary
undergraduate education, including proficiency with essential skills and competencies, familiarization
with disciplinary and interdisciplinary ways of knowing, and enhancement of the values and disposition
of an engaged 21st century global citizenry.
Moreover, SUNY General Education promotes equity by equipping SUNY undergraduates, regardless of
background, program of study, or campus, with foundational capacities fostered through a broad liberal
education to prepare them for further study, work, life, and global citizenship. It encourages students to
explore subjects and learning experiences beyond their intended major and fosters a commitment to
personal growth and life-long learning.
Importantly, SUNY General Education supports seamless transfer of students between and among SUNY
institutions and it ensures consistency in expected system-level learning outcomes while enabling
individual campuses to develop unique signature features, including their respective array of
educational offerings and pedagogical approaches.
STATEMENT OF VALUES AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES
SUNY General Education (GE) is a system-wide framework applicable to all SUNY undergraduate degree
programs that addresses the fundamental goals of higher education, including proficiency with essential
skills, familiarization with disciplinary and interdisciplinary ways of knowing, and enhancement of the
values and disposition of an engaged 21st century global citizenry.
SUNY’s General Education rests on the following guiding principles:
1. SUNY GE promotes equity by equipping all SUNY undergraduates—regardless of background,
program of study, or campus—with foundational capacities fostered through a broad liberal
education to prepare them for further study, work, life, and global citizenship.
2. SUNY GE encourages students to explore subjects and learning experiences beyond their intended
major and fosters a commitment to personal growth and life-long learning.
3. SUNY GE aligns with SUNY’s commitment to deep and engaged learning and encourages persistence,
completion, and success.
4. SUNY GE supports seamless transfer of students between and among SUNY institutions; it ensures
consistency in expected learning outcomes while enabling individual campuses to develop unique
signature features, including their respective array of educational offerings and pedagogical
approaches.
5. SUNY GE specifies minimum requirements; campuses may set additional expectations, as long as
those expectations remain consistent with SUNY policy, NYS regulation and education law, and
institutional accreditation standards and expectations.
6. SUNY GE is internally consistent and coherent, and readily understood by students, faculty, staff,
and other internal and external stakeholders.

7

Implementation Guidance SUNY General Education
(Draft 9-8-2021)
7. SUNY GE includes clear and measurable student learning outcomes, assessed by campuses on an
ongoing basis to ensure high-quality educational experiences for all undergraduate students;
similarly, SUNY GE policy is reviewed regularly to ensure that it is effective, relevant, and up-to-date.
OVERVIEW OF THE SUNY GENERAL EDUCATION FRAMEWORK
The SUNY GE framework includes twelve categories of knowledge, skills and competencies—ten
knowledge and skills areas expose students to different ways of knowing so that they can make
reasoned judgements outside as well as inside their academic field, and enabling them to develop
diverse perspectives and global understanding; and two core competencies that extend beyond
discipline-specific knowledge and skills. Among the specific knowledge and skills categories is a new
requirement, Diversity: Equity, Inclusion, and Social Justice. This requirement aligns with the SUNY Board
of Trustees’ Policy on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (adopted September 10, 2015) as well as SUNY’s
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Phase I Action Plan (2021), which recommends including a diversity
category in the general education requirements. In addition, explicitly delineated skills and
competencies in quantitative reasoning, scientific reasoning, oral and written communication, critical
thinking and reasoning, and information literacy help to ensure SUNY graduates have the 21st century
knowledge, skills, and competencies they need, while also satisfying institutional accreditation
expectations. Finally, the framework provides flexibility for campuses to develop innovative and robust
local general education programs for their respective undergraduate degrees.
SUNY GENERAL EDUCATION KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS AREAS, AND COMPETENCIES

• demonstrate an understanding of the structures, systems, and interrelationships among
civilizations and cultures within historical and/or contemporary contexts, and their impact on
wellbeing and sustainability.
III. Guidance (draft)
Courses on specialized topics or periods—examples include: classical mythology, the Renaissance,
the Bible, French civilization, the history of theater—are approvable so long as the materials
demonstrate that the primary focus of the course relates to larger cultural developments of world
history. Courses that focus narrowly on particular authors or figures are generally not approvable,
even if the authors in question should be very important ones. The operative idea is that the core of
the course must be central to world history and global awareness, and the treatment of that core
placed in broader cultural perspective so that students gain an acquaintance with world history and
not just specialized knowledge of one narrowly defined topic.
The study of indigenous populations is approvable in this category.

World Languages
I.

Label
World Languages

II. Student Learning Outcomes
Students will
• exhibit basic proficiency in the understanding and use of a world language; and
• demonstrate knowledge of the distinctive features of culture(s) associated with the language
they are studying.
III. Guidance (draft)
The first college semester, or above, of a world language constitutes an approvable course in this
category. American Sign Language courses are also approvable for SUNY GE World Languages.
It is acknowledged that campuses have widely differing practices and available resources for the
assessment of world languages preparation. Previously acquired language competence may be
determined by a standard measure selected or developed by the relevant faculty and should
demonstrate the student’s readiness to enter the second college semester of language study. Many
campuses have, and are encouraged to have, language requirements that go beyond the minimum
established by the SUNY General Education policy.
