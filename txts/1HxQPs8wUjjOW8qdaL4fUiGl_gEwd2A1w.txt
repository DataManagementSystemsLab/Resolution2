Overview

Why am I Here?

A 

SUNY Task Force

 has been working on Micro-Credentialing, and recently 

released

 its 

report and recommendations

.

I have been leading our investigation

 and planning regarding them since they have seemed particularly suited to SPS.

In fact, I realized that the 

SPS has a 

pair of 

courses

 that would be very 

appropriate for 

a 

Micro-Credential

.

And so 

I submitted a Proposal to CAP

 in April 

requesting

:

That 

a structure for 

awarding 

Micro-Credentials

 be created.

That the

 College’s 

first Micro-Credential be

 the one mentioned above.

The 

Senate

 is now 

organizing a proces

s to 

decide if

, and if so 

how

, the College will 

award Micro-Credential

s.

The Executive Committee offered me the chance to make 

this presentation

 as 

part of starting that process

, and since I have heard of many questions and concerns about Micro-Credentials, I accepted.

What are Micro-Credentials?

Micro-Credentials are 

awards

 given to students 

for

 

the achievement of 

specific

 sets of 

skills or competencies

.  

These 

can be achieved through 

credit or non-credit 

work,

which 

can be 

distributed 

across 

a variety of 

courses or activities 

and 

measured by 

performance on 

specific 

assessments

 

(like, say, Research skills

), 

or

 contained 

in a defined set of courses or activities 

and 

measured by 

their correspondence to 

the courses’ 

learning 

outcomes or 



the activities

’ 

general objectives

 

(like, say, 2 classes on managing non-profits)

.

They are 

named for 

specific industry-specified 

certification or 

professional 

accreditations, 

where appropriate,

or

 are more 

generically referred to as “badges.”

The name 

is derived from clickable digital icons embedded in online 

resumes or LinkedIn profiles 

linking to 

pages with validating information.

Why are They Being Used?

To motivate 

current 

students 

by offering tangible rewards for steps toward degree between course completion and graduation.

To

 

enhance employability 

of current students by certifying skills, either not generally recognized within a program or as professional add-ons.

To

 

raise revenue 

by drawing in non-matriculated students.

To increase enrollments 

by drawing non-matriculated students to move from badges to degree programs.

They can be created quickly and easily

	SUNY has made them an entirely campus-based process.

SUNY stipulates that they be developed 

through established faculty governance processes and designed to be meaningful and high 

quality.

They do not need to go through approval by SUNY or registration with SED.

How are They Being Used?

Nationally,

 Micro-Credentials 

are 

being awarded by an increasing number of accredited institutions 

of higher 

learning for both credit and non-credit work. 

Within 

SUNY

, a Task Force of the SUNY 

Faculty Advisory Council 

on Teaching and Technology recently issued a report with 

guidelines

 for their adoption by SUNY schools, which the SUNY 

Board of Trustees unanimously endorsed

 at its January, 2018 meeting

.

They are being developed at 

Alfred State, University at Albany, 

Hudson 

Valley Educational Consortium, University at Buffalo,

and Stony Brook, 

which has 

started using them at 

sub-certificate level within credit bearing graduate programs

.  

It 

offers 

17 2-3 

class

 

badges 

for 

Educators (

inc.

 3 Humanities) 

and 6 in 

Business

Ideas for Use at Old Westbury

A Badge in Non-Profit Management

 (SPS)

2 Professional Studies courses: 

Non-profit Stewardship

Financial Administration of Non-profits

Currently offered Saturday afternoons as part of the SPS and History and Philosophy’s Congregational Leadership minor.

Would be a natural set to offer :

current students interested in developing practical skills to further their pursuit of the College’s Social Justice mission and 

to members of the larger community to enhance their skills in this area.

A Badge in Advanced Writing 

(WAC)

an award for taking 3 Writing Intensive classes at a high level of achievement.
