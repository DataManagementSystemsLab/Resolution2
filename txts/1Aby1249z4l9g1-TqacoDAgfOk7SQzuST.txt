II. Activities
Meetings
During fall 2018, the Committee held monthly face-to-face meetings, and online discussions.
Three members of the Committee (C. DeVirgilio, D. Quarless, J. Spadaro,) also serve as Leads for
SUNY’s OER funded initiatives on campus and attend SUNY OER Services online meetings twice
monthly.
SUNY OER Funding, Proposals for New OER Courses, & Faculty Stipends
SUNY received $4 million from the State of New York Excelsior Scholarship to support the
adoption and creation of open educational resources in the 2018-2019 academic year. SUNY
approved our campus’ application for funding, and has renewed funding for OER initiatives at
Old Westbury for 2018-2019. This fall Old Westbury received $12,000 from SUNY. This amount
includes $10,000 baseline funding for having a minimum requirement of 5 new OER course
sections and a FTE under 10,000, plus $2000 additional for course section funding ($300 per
section for course sections that exceed the campus 5 course minimum, $500 per section for a
course if all sections are converted to OER). The College may receive an additional $1,000$2000 in spring 2019, depending on the number of new OER sections posted in the course
registration system. We also have $2224 in rolled-over funds from the prior funding cycle.
On June 1, 2018 the OER Ad Hoc Committee sent out a call for proposals for the development
of new OER courses for fall 2018. We received, reviewed, and approved 10 course proposals (5
at the adopt, 3 at the adapt, 2 at the create development levels). Proposals are reviewed by
faculty members of the Committee and the Instructional Designer. The total amount of faculty
incentive stipends awarded for the ten courses is $8500. Stipends will be disbursed when the
courses are taught.

On November 8, 2018 the Committee sent out a call for proposals for new OER courses in
spring 2019. That application process is still open and available for all faculty.
OER Course Tagging
The Committee also reviewed OER course syllabi and course materials (for funded and
unfunded courses) to determine whether they meet SUNY’s requirements to be labeled as an
OER course and tagged with the OER attribute in the course registration system. The following
tables represents all the OER courses that were tagged from summer 2018 to present. We are
still accepting spring 2019 OER course syllabi for tagging.
