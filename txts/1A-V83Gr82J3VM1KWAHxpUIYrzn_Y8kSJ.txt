 Check one.

[  X  ]     This proposal is for a multi-award program  that  leads  to  two
      separate awards  (e.g.,  A.S./B.A.,  B.S./M.S.).   Complete  Part  2A,
      below.    NOTE:  Such programs generally  involve  special  admissions
      for students who have the capacity to complete all awards,  curricular
      integration between the component  programs,  and  shortened  time  to
      degree compared to taking the programs separately.

 [    ]     This proposal is for a multi-institution program (also called  a
      “jointly registered program”) to be offered jointly  by  two  or  more
      institutions.  Complete Part B, below.   NOTE:  Such programs  involve
      a formal agreement between two or more institutions to  offer  courses
      leading to an award.

[    ]      This proposal is for a  multi-institution,  multi-award  program
      to be offered jointly by more two or more institutions and lead to two
      separate  awards.   Provide  a  single,  consolidated  response   that
      reflects all the items in Parts 2A and 2B, below.

PART 2A – Multi-Award Program

a) Program Title: Combined B.A. /M.A.T. in Chemistry Adolescence Education

b) Program Awards ((e.g., B.A./M.S.) from existing  programs):  Bachelor  of
   Arts in Chemistry/ Master of  Arts   in  Teaching  Chemistry  Adolescence
   Education

c) Proposed HEGIS Code: 1905.01

d) Required Number of Credits:  Minimum    [  156     ]       If  tracks  or
   options, largest minimum [      ]

e) Format:  [ X ] Day    [X  ] Evening  [  ] Weekend     [  ]
   Evening/Weekend     [  ] Not Full-Time

f) Mode:    [ X ] Standard   [  ] Independent Study   [  ] External   [ ]
   Accelerated

      [  ]  Distance Education  (If 50% of more of the program can be
   completed via distance education,

      append a Distance Education Format Proposal at the end of this form.)



g)   Other:    [  ] Bilingual  [  ] Language Other Than English   [  ]
   Upper Division Program   [  ] Cooperative

   4.5 year    [ X ] 5 year

h)    List registered programs at the institution identified  in  Section  1
   whose courses will contribute to this program.  Add rows as needed.

|         |Chemistry Adolescence Education  |          |                 |


i) List all the courses required for each  existing  program,  and  indicate
   which ones will be counted toward both awards.  See attachment 1
j) What is the length of time students will have to  complete  the  proposed
   program? 5 years
k) k)     What are the admissions requirements for the new program, and  how
are they related to student success?
   Candidates must apply for the program by the end of Junior year.  They
   must have 12 credits of residency. All candidates must have completed
   four lab science courses and show a GPA of 3.25 overall and 3.25 in the
   courses required for the Chemistry B.A. degree.  An interview is
   required.
   Transfer students ‘GPA must meet Old Westbury’s GPA requirements and
   transfer courses must be calculated along with Old Westbury grades for
   admission to this program.


   Candidates must submit an application that includes
   •  An essay
   •  GRE scores
   •  Two letters of reference from faculty
   •  All college transcripts
   Highly qualified candidates will complete the program in  five  years  by
   accelerating undergraduate coursework, and moving on to graduate study in
   the fourth year.   Candidates must maintain a GPA of 3.25 (overall and in
   the major) in each semester of study.  Additionally, no grades of  D  are
   permitted for any required courses, and candidates must meet requirements
   of the Chemistry major.  Those whose GPA falls below 3.25will  be  placed
   on probation and will  have  one  semester  to  bring  up  their  grades.
   Candidates  who  fail  to  complete  the  five-year   program   will   be
   administratively transferred into the Chemistry major, and will  graduate
   with the B.A. degree.


   Complete a SUNY Sample Program Schedule to show how students will be able
   to schedule all required courses to complete the multi-award program.
