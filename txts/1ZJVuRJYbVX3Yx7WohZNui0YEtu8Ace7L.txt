II. Activities
The TLRC works to provide resources, conversation spaces, and opportunities for faculty to address and
adapt to the everchanging teaching environment. The TLRC also worked to create events in agreement
with the resolution in support of the Black Lives Matter movement in dedicating the 2020-2021
academic year to hosting events in exploring topics of (in)equality, (in)justice, and movements for social
change.
During the remote 2020-2021 academic year, the TLRC hosted a New Faculty Orientation focused on
teaching-issues for 11 new full-time faculty, and hosted four roundtable discussions. The TLRC cosponsored the ARPT’s and UUP’s annual “Getting to Tenure and Beyond” workshop. Furthermore, the
TLRC co- sponsored alongside CETL, Parity, and the School of Arts and Sciences a workshop on
“Integrating Decolonialism and Anti-Racism: Humanizing the Higher Education Classroom.” Finally, the
TLRC sponsored the senate resolution and supported of the creation of the Innovation Lab. In addition
to these activities (also listed below), the TLRC held a total of six business meetings.

The committee continued to serve in an advisory capacity to the Center for Excellence in Teaching and
Learning (CETL) in its third full year of activity and represented faculty teaching needs and requirements
on the Distance Learning Taskforce.
Please note that members of the TLRC rely heavily on the expertise and participation of our colleagues
to develop successful initiatives, and always welcome suggestions/volunteers for presenters.
