  IV. University Senator Report (Laurette Morris)
      - Laurie Travels all over NYC to represent Old Westbury
      - 2 handouts: faculty senate report, and faculty senate preliminary
        schedule
      - Laurie showed a map of the 64 campuses in NY state.
      - The number one issue is the impact of Excelsior. Enrollment was down
        but we here at OW have done well. Other places were losing students
        because of it.  The major beneficiary of Excelsior was mostly white
        students, mostly middle class, other lower income students get other
        benefits.
      - Some campuses have decreased enrollment, budget concerns, issues
        with infrastructure and worry about sustainability.
      - More fulltime faculty is needed to accommodate the new students
        coming in.
      - Every representative at the plenary expressed budgeting concerns and
        a general lack of transparency.
      - The SUNY Chancellor and Provost talked about the online initiative.
        Dominated in terms of initiative… they were given 26 vendor
        recommendations.
      - Chancellor sees online classrooms as win win since it increases
        enrollment of students who are not already in the system to become
        involved.
      - However this could also lead to possible loss of revenue.
      - How will this impact of online classes, impact physical classes?
      - There is a Working group of 39 members.
      - According to new provost… marketing and outreach is what is needed
      - Some professors do not ever want to teach online classes.  One
        senator in comparative literature stated, “I plan to die in the
        middle of a sentence in my class room!” So it has been met with
        major opposition.
      - Some campuses already invested lots of resources.   We are at a
        point where we are as well.
      - “Is anyone at OW part of the 39?” Question from the gallery
      - There is a concern that general education is not keeping up with
        modern times.
      - A lot of data, various campuses and degrees at OW we are doing very
        well. As of domain, foreign language doing not so well.
      - When you read report compliance, we are in much better shape than
        some in other campuses.
      - Person: when SUNY went in as one of the 7 out of the 10 we are
        substantially in compliant with Middle States.
      - General Education wasn’t keeping up with modern times, what does
        that mean? Not clear but we want to meet the needs of the 21st
        century. We will need more feedback.
      - Duncan Quarless: transfer plan and general education
      - SUNY wants to adopt a universal sexual harassment statement. To
        develop policies surrounding sexual and romantic relationships
        across the board.
      - Campus governance should be involved in creating such policies.  We
        have time.
      - Maureen Dolan asked: is such policy for students or for staff? The
        answer is, it is for everyone.
      - SGA is doing a lot on each campus to address various student issues
        such as homelessness, medical emergencies, poverty, other life
        emergencies.
      - March 2019, this conference was supposed to be this semester but
        moved… issues of vulnerability student life committee this is the
        theme
      - Student assembly is teaming up with other states such as California
        to lobby in Washington DC. We have some awesome student reps!
      - Student assembly put together an informational packet regarding
        voting, sending it out to all the students electronically, including
        what’s on the ballot and what it means. There is a registration
        drive to get out the vote.
      - L. Morris says she can send other reports and documents via email as
        not to overload faculty right now with all the information.
      - Lee Blackstone:  the online initiative if you have any question
        contact DR. Gwen kay and cc Ed Bever. As he is the head of online
        and distance learning here at OW
      -

  V.  President’s Report
      - The President is not here today.

Anthony Barbera
      - The SPARR task force is creating the structure of the SPAAR
        committee.  The first meeting is scheduled for next Friday.  The
        Task Force will complete work by end of fall so committee can start
        by spring.
      - Submitting report next week about campus site visit Dec 6 and 7 it
        will be helpful to visitors
      - If you are interested in SPAAR, and in the implementation plan,
        please check the  strategic plan documents found on the Faculty
        Senate website.
Jacob Heller
      - Will talk about Middle states, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, self-
        study institute… will be reviewed with site visit in 2021…
        octennial. self-study and site visit process… first formal steps.
        Meet every week
      - In the spring… we will begin working on a self-study design and road
        map…to substantiate self-study.
      - Self-study design has to be given by middle of spring, middle states
        vice president, liaison sometime in the spring. As part of self-
        study documents, will lay out how the work will be done and who will
        be doing the work.
      - Initiations will be going out 100 people will be involved 50
        %faculty 50% staff and admin. Also, there will be students on every
        working group.
      - The reason that middle states is important is that we must be
        accredited, without it, students cannot use financial aid.
      - Half of the schools failed accreditation. Every accreditation event
        carries the risk that something may go wrong.
      - Access to analytic service, for the campus it will be 90% off, what
        it will offer us, after meeting with the team. An intro into the
        kinds of data that we will see in November. On campus visits their
        going to do a projection of what our enrollment will look like. They
        are going to give us high level information. Things we should focus
        on and where opportunities exist and how many section of a course to
        offer in fall 2019. Once students register for class in fall. banner
        data… those students actual course enrollments to project what the
        optimal schedule will be for fall
      - Not about times of day but how many sections will you need to offer.
        Over enroll or under enroll.
      - Advise and prediction and in addition, providing information to
        deans and grad directors…an academic class schedule that is more
        based on student demand…based on our sense on what might be needed.
        Student centered filtered
      - Maureen: do they have access to recent historical data for people
        wanting to register? No wait list in banner, attempts to register do
        not exist. This feeds out of banner so if there is banner data than
        they can have it.
      - When did they start? Last summer
Duncan Quarless
      - We had to leave Scantron, student course evaluation system called
        Blue will replace it
      - We are behind with original implementation schedule which only
        affects school of business
      - First sequence of courses we were not able to evaluate
      - There is a November 6th test date
      - Begin actual evaluations 10 or 12th week. Week after thanksgiving.
      - Still attempting to give the widest window we can to complete the
        evaluation, Blue is allowing us to use an automated entity in their
        system to roll over from semester to semester. Closes at 93%.
      - Spirit of resolution from faculty, in original implementation, data
        for applied learning courses… we have now added OER because it was
        something that happened after initial implementation… teaching goals
        associated with the tool.
      - We are already experiencing great technical support
      - Jacob Heller asked question: in terms of access to report with
        maximum student engagement. Who will get access? Will there be
        student access to the evaluation reports?
      - Students will be able to search a course evaluation database simply
        by putting in a name. the problem from Blue, as it is constructed
        they may not be able to go back in a timeline to make such a search.
        We are looking into potential alternative as we backup our own data
        here on the campus
      - The other part of Blue is aggregate reporting, will be available to
        department chairs and deans of schools at their level.
      - They will have access to aggregate report of all the members of
        their respective cohorts
      - The Micro credential task force. Done, now in the hands of CAP, the
        preliminary presentation will happen later this afternoon with no
        thunder stealing but glimpse of what is being proposed…credit
        bearing micro credentials are the only things come through…. modeled
        after current mechanism…
      - Pilot of what is proposed, every school has one proposal that is
        included that’s in the proposal that is being sent to CAP, planned
        evaluation in the fall at that point there will be determination so
        that a decision will be made in the spring as to how to move forward
      - Provost: presentation on micro credentials. will be available on the
        web. Interesting to see what’s being done in other campuses…general
        conclusion is that the term badges will not be used… negative
        connotation…micro credentials sounds better
      - We are going on the proposal, like everything else we have the
        concerns of how to deal with new.  One or two people… outside of the
        mechanism part, for purpose of tagging and tracking, third party
        vendor in proposal.
      - Laurie Morris: only credit bearing proposals have been submitted.
        Some campuses have both but all submissions credit or not go through
        the academic side of the outs
      - Duncan Quarelss states that: essentially when a student takes a
        course that is flagged as being part of a micro credential we must
        track the student’s outcome in that course
      - If micro credential is 3 courses. We must be able to tag and track
      - A 3rd party vendor, helps with the tracking part because we don’t
        and also as we sanctioned issues with the micro credential.
      - After verified by 3rd party based on criteria, a message comes back
        that the student can have it, the credential is then issued…
        digitally so that it can then be inserted into LinkedIn or wherever
        the student chooses.
      - Annual report-help us with creation of the icon, of what the
        credential will look like…CAP will discuss… feels bad about getting
        ahead of CAP because they have not met yet. Must touch base with
        CAP, proposal gives window of time that conflicts.


  VI. Provost Report
      - 3 handouts were distributed,  How to Treat Visiting Professors with
        Dignity, Stats Gathered in Advising Help Colleges Rethink Intro
        Courses, and Here’s What Today’s Students Want From College. All
        found on The Chronicle of Higher Education.
      - Stats gathered in advising help
      - Updated on DSI process… preliminary development
      - Adhoc committee people… process began with discussion on how much
        money was available 1% of based salary 155k…after determination
      - We then needed a list of eligible faculty and staff and eligible
        adjunct…all three groups are open for bonus. To be paid out before
        Christmas. Had trouble of getting reliable data
      - When our group of 7 met they talked about equity, all awards would
        be based on merit with 3 classifications including, highly
        commendable and commendable. Primarily for faculty. Staff and
        adjuncts decided another way. This was done totally within academic
        affairs
      - With One classification for staff.
      - Anthony Barbera: staff evaluations were gone through prices utilized
        throughout the college. Rated on a scale from one to 5 through human
        resources
      - Got a list from 3 deans, list of recommendations went to the table.
        Went through individually the list of names, all of the recommended
        faculty, reviewed recommendations, made or approved what has been
        submitted. No final outcome yet, occurred yesterday afternoon
      - Pool was 155k and initially we assumed that the full pool of money
        155k, will go to fulltime faculty only. Yesterday we were told we
        had to include adjunct faculty
      - After 24 hours’ process was opened again, the deadline is too soon.
      - Thanks to Jacob and Duncan, they worked to do revisions.  However,
        no final list yet
      - So, he will put in writing, sometime in December after we get a
        final list of recipients of awards.
      - Next year there will be another 1% of UUP payroll that will be
        dedicated to equity and other half devoted to merit… divided into
        two parts… two payments to people who get it… first amount of 115k
        then through the retroactive pay. First check big then the second
        one smaller.
      - 155k available pool? Does that include adjunct salaries too? Yes.
        staff is in a different pool
      - Does a bi yearly conversation with Kimmins still exist in regards to
        increases to salary?
      - What does exist is a community that includes members of the
        committee that handles increases of salaries for staff and faculty
        meets in June and December.
      - Increases who have contacted academic affairs… decides on some kind
        of increase based on merit…who knows what they are assessing…
        committee in HR created by the president but needs more information
        as well as needs confirmation by Mr. Kimmins
      - What do student want? Scared… try to summarize… we need commitment
        to resources… if we do not have that we do not have broad
        learning…in reference to hand out… if we do not have that, people
        will notice that we will not be able to improve the program. We need
        to invest somehow along the way to allocate budget for this…ne
        faculty, ne courses, new computers… if you want to have SPAAR,
        whatever name you want… be proactive…

  VII.      Special Order of Business

     A. Parliamentary procedure (Jacob Heller)
      - Was invited by EC to talk, says its’s good to have a lawyer when you
        go to court because the lawyer understands
      - Just a system to facilitate open and fair discussion
      - OW Faculty Senate has a prevision that says we follow Roberts rules
        of order
      - It Streamlines the system
      - He’s handed out just the basics. Roberts Rules of order
      - Third to the bottom where is talks about suspending the rules, we
        can suspend the formal process, but this is debatable, the senate at
        any time can move on business that it feels is important and can
        suspend Roberts Rules by majority vote if necessary. It is a legal
        system for organizing
      - People need to live by the rules. The more you know the better you
        will be able to support your department.
      - Speak to the issue, respect other people’s time, move business
        forward, parliamentary procedure is for this, use this in department
        meetings. Things will move faster.
      - Question on number 3: quorum must be present… quorum isn’t an issue
        unless someone raises an issue, parties stop meetings from happening
        by not showing up.
      - Emails are always welcome.

  VIII.     Old Business

     A.     Meeting times (Peter Ikeler)
    - Informational presentation, helping us understand the possibilities of
      flexibilities in the schedule
    - This is based on the issue of 1 person needing a time change.
    - target population of 56 people. 33 people responded.
    - Referencing the Survey Monkey chart. green bar yes, blue bar no, of
      the people who took the survey, 25 were senators or alternates. The
      remaining 8 were ex officio members
    - If faculty senate meetings were held at different time, would they
      people to come?
    - The current time is the best time, is what was concluded.
    - twice a semester there is a full faculty meeting. There seems to be a
      pretty strong approval to move them to morning. Might be possible to
      happen in the future.
    - We have the information, if senators want to make a proposal or put
      into new business. Up to senators to decide if a resolution needs to
      happen. Info necessary if you need a resolution
    - when the survey was created, if folks were informed that this is a
      religious confliction rather than convenience, would people be more
      willing to answer?  people’s opinion on religious inclusion is taken
      into consideration, chair did not want this.
    - If senators want to raise this as an issue of inclusion they can.
    - Number of people who couldn’t possibly attend in terms of religious
      inclusion and how to raise potential new business.
    - How to make things accessible to people who are not able to attend is
      another conversation.

  IX.       New Business

     A. Resolution on “smart” classrooms
      - Found in back of packet, easy to find and was entered into the
        record at last meeting
      - Needs to be read into the record, need to introduce the resolve part
        of it
      - The chair reads entire resolution out loud.
      - Motion accepted and seconded.
      - Chair ask if there are any that are For or against? Does anyone have
        Comments or amendments
      - Time frame, advise to be prompt, but what time frame? Found to be
        unclear, can be a proposed amendment to be changed to something more
        specific… suggestion is to put a deadline on it
      - Are we talking about a deadline on the report to be done?  Have a
        time line for each. To academic affairs they should report by end of
        semester and before last faculty senate meeting.
      - This will be an amendment, in order to peruse the amendment,
        promptly changed to report on state of the problem be done by the
        end of the semester and replacement by start on spring semester.
        201.
      - We can say that, not going to happen. There is awareness but do not
        have the ability to change by spring 2019.
      - Motion to change the language
      - Motion brought and seconded by Lisa Payton
      - Fred? The report will assess the state of every classroom…can make
        report available to all faculty.
      - Which rooms are considered smart room? NAB, library even though all
        of our classrooms are considered smart classrooms… but strictly
        defined NAB, library and a few in the science.
      - Essentially all working classrooms that have technology in them.
      - 27 for the amendment no opposition, no abstentions
      - One of the things not mentioned here, a lot of the classrooms are
        becoming more and more interactive…cameras and such, cameras and
        microphones should be there…
      - Inquire with Evan, library classrooms do not have that already…this
        resolution only goes with making what we already have, fixing what
        is broken. Not expansion.
      - Are you moving to change it to classroom technology and remove the
        word smart? Ali… the issues are classrooms that have podiums,
        screens, DVD players…this is the technology that we are addressing…
        do we want all technology fixed?
      - Are we asking to assess every classroom that has technology? No new
        things just fixing what is already there…
      - IT governance, this is first in series of resolutions
      - Amendment to remove the word smart… replace smart classrooms and
        replace with JUST classrooms.
      - Deleted quotation marks so it will read ++in each of our
        classrooms++.
      -  Change title from smart classrooms to classrooms. “American studies
        resolutions on maintenance of classroom technology.”
      - First whereas and removal of the word smart to just classrooms in
        all of the document
      - Seconded by Veronika. 24 voted yes 0 opposed 0 abstentions
      - Changing title and first whereas
      - Led to ambiguity, so changing language to make sure every classroom
        with any kind of technology works.
      - Minor amendment 3rd whereas. 2nd sentence. Parenthetical statement
        that raises serious privacy concerns, needed to provide a driver’s
        license raises security and privacy concerns.  23 in favor 0 opposed
        0 abstentions
      - Back to whole resolution
      - When raises issue of bandwidth…signaling to admin and IT that we
        want things to be better but we will not be able to increase this by
        the beginning of the spring. Signaling that we want this to be
        better but we know it won’t change.
      - Set aside as clause so IT won’t dismiss it?... change 4th whereas to
        bandwidth, to signal to IT that it is important.
      - Most of the bandwidth hardware is not even located in the
        classrooms.
      - Most streaming content relies on bandwidth, commas ok, but removing
        the issue of bandwidth all together no good.
      - Ray Maggiore will be available in the library. Great!
      - Amendment, comma and addition to. The 4th whereas. Adds a comma
        after issues and in addition bandwidth 26 in favor, 0 opposed 1
        abstention
      - Any further amendments or discussion, calling the question 23 in
        favor 1 opposed. 0 abstention

        resolution carried


     motion to extend meeting by 15 minutes… it was seconded by Laurie
     Morris 24 yes, 3 opposed 0 abstentions


  X.  Call to Senators: sharing of concerns

      - Laurie Morris speaks again
      - support for lactation facility on campus
      - gender neutral language, all communications coming from SUNY will
        use they/their or theirs…. instead of she/he…binary language
      - That we advocate that SUNY become first higher education institution
        that is test optional SAT, ACT… greatest number of no’s
      - reinstituting a graduate fellow option


     A.     Mold Issue
          - Mold in NAB (Laurie Morris) 3103… mold in 2105… has not been
            reported to facilities but needs to be.
          - Report to secretaries of any issues found who will pass on this
            information.
          - Work order system. Unless it is an IT problem then you fill out
            service request with them, all others head towards facilities
          - Bill Kimmins says if it is safety, Tim McGary in facilities or
            Mr. Kimmins in HR are the point people for quality in the
            rooms… emergency
          - Channel 12 and 7 reported on mold issue at Old Westbury
          - It is a serious issue and hoping that it will be a lesson for
            us. Rash on back of student. Response…be proactive (ALI
            speaking) we need to make sure we are not going to have bad
            press.
          - Lee Blackstone, his experience is that sometimes you do not see
            it. Heat or air unit, watching what comes out, it is not
            pleasant
          - Some report on what they are doing about these issues, does the
            Senate want the EC to find answers to this?
          - Very important that we encourage students to work with student
            affairs on these issues. Make sure people know about it
          - Old Westbury becoming poster child? Usama Shaikh, first time in
            his 15 years that this has been an issue. The weather, high
            humidity levels have been insane. Exacerbating the mold issue.
          - Whenever a student has notified them in residential life, they
            have responded in hours now days…lowering temperature…doing air
            quality test from an external vendor.
          - There is concern for students…addressed heating and cooling
            unit addressing those issues within the resident’s halls.
          - Reimbursing for any items that need to be replaced due to the
            mold
          - A student who came to express concerns stated that the mold
            issue in her room was reported 3 weeks ago but cleaned today, 3
            different times, parents had to call to get it fixed… health
            wise… dehumidifiers worked to get rid of mold but not everyone
            can breathe in it. RD was told, 3 times.
          - The student lives in a single room but they want to move
            someone else in on top of mold.
          - The work orders have not being attended to, bathrooms have been
            flooding… 4 bathrooms, shower curtain moves, body exposed.
            Conditions reported… door knob is about to fall off this was
            reported on the first day.
          - OW known for talking about the issues. Not afraid to talk but
            wants something to be done with it. Been here for 3 years but
            wants to transfer… and her father graduated from here…she wants
            change.
          - Taj ford- when? Problem since the summer… Usama knew about this
            in august…addressed by facilities. Looking from his side, he
            cannot do something if it’s not being reported… going off the
            strength of work order system…  nature conspiring against them
          - Students lack of cooperation or understanding of our
            heating/cooling unit…notified students not to open their
            windows… which would add to mold issue… air coming through…
            window cracked we would see the mold…
          - Some students complied and some did not. Making things worse
            before it could get better “mold in one room is one room too
            many” said Usama Shaikh
          - Once notified we had staff involved using mold inhibitors, he
            felt that they were in front of this but the weather causes
            them to fall behind
          - Another student stated that someone came to the dorm room door
            with a bucket and spray bottle of bleach… Usama Shaikh stated
            that this was exactly what was told not to do… but again
            students must tell them when there is an issue

  XI. Announcements
          - There were no announcements
