Issues and Recommendations

We worked for a number of weeks without our full committee membership.
The task of the committee is complicated by the fact that there are several grievance policies on
campus – undergraduate, School of Education, and School of Business. Since there is some
overlap in terms of student populations, this can be confusing.
The undergraduate policy is still lengthy, complex, and confusing. It would be a good idea to
condense and simplify it.
Perhaps we could design a webinar on the Bylaws that faculty could review at their convenience
to address the requirement that the FR & R committee offer a presentation on the bylaws each
fall. The webinar could include a brief quiz and a certificate of completion, and could be part of
the orientation process.
