Mr. James Llana

Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate
State University of New York College at Old Westbury
Old Westbury, NY 11568
Dear Mr. Llana:

Thank you for your letter of May 30 regarding the dormitory project at SUNY Old
Westbury.
You asked when the campus participated in the selection of a contractor for the
project. The December 14, 1998, issue of the New York State Contract Reporter
contained the pubic advertisement seeking expressions of interest in the project from
design/build teams, the first step in the contractor procurement process. On December 2,
1999, the evaluation committee notified The Vanderbilt Group LLC that it had been
selected.
You also asked who represented the College at Old Westbury on the professional
committee evaluating the contractors’ proposals. Vice President for Administration
Albert E. Smith, Elaine Frazier and Jacqueline Weber represented the College.
We continue to work with the surety and with officials from the campus and from
SUNY central administration to help move the project forward.
I trust this information will be useful to you.
Sincerely,

Thomas J. Murphy

Executive Director
