WHEREAS,     The  School  of  Education  and  Department  of  History/Social
          Studies  Track  and  Philosophy  have  found  significant  student
          interest in a 5 year  program  that  will  result  in  a  combined
          Bachelor of Arts  in  History  and  Master  of  Arts  in  Teaching
          /Social Studies Adolescence Education, and

WHEREAS,    The proposed  5  year  program  revises  two  existing  programs
          (Bachelor of Arts in History/Social Studies Track  and  Master  of
          Arts in Teaching Social Studies Adolescence Education) into one  5
          year combined program, and

WHEREAS,    The proposed  5  year  combined  B.A./M.A.T  will  allow  highly
          qualified students to complete both a Bachelor of Arts  degree  in
          History/Social Studies Track and a  Master  of  Arts  in  Teaching
          Social  Studies/  Adolescence  Education  degree  in  5  years  by
          accelerating undergraduate coursework and taking graduate  courses
          in their 4th year of study, and

WHEREAS,    The proposed 5 year program consists entirely  of  courses  that
          are already offered in the School of Education curriculum and  the
          curriculum of other departments involved  in  this  program,  thus
          mitigating the need for any additional resources, and

WHEREAS,    The proposed 5 year program allows students to fulfill  the  New
          York State requirement of obtaining a Masters degree in  order  to
          qualify for their teaching certification, and

WHEREAS,    The School  of  Education  has  determined  that  students  with
          Masters degrees have a higher  passing  rate  on  New  York  State
          teaching certification examinations.


THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED

      That the Senate approves the proposed Combined  Bachelor  of  Arts  in
