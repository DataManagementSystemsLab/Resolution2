Timeline on the process of implementing capital projects

In 2003 the College was informed that the 2003-2008 Capital Plan would be changed to 20042009 by State Construction Fund. Over the 2003-04 BPC worked on defining projects and
moved to the Request For Qualifications phase in several projects.

Current Capital Projects will be funded from

In the spring of 2003 the BPC recommended to the President that with the training facility funds
not being allocated to a new academic building the Academic Village’s interior and exterior
would be the focus of those funds.

for the Academic Village interior, facades for Academic Village and the
well as data wiring for the interiors of the campus buildings. We have

chosen designers for Academic Village interior rehab and the College has just received approval
to begin the design phase. Assuming no SUCF follows through architects will be interviewing
campus constituents and designing in the spring semester. We will require SUCF’s approval to
go ahead with the construction phase.

Other potential work in the Campus Center could include some renovations to registrar front
window and office space vacated by financial aid, rehab of Visual Arts studios and gallery.

Beyond the Campus Center the campus needs repair the fire alarm and provide for a fire
suppression system in Computing Services.
The committee also agreed that an assessment of the needs and future use of the library should
be undertaken with the eventual result a major design renovation. The committee has not had
enough time to assess other possibilities but will continue to do so.
