TO:

SUBJ:

SUNY OLD WESTBURY STRATEGIC PLAN (SPAAR COMMITTEE)

With this memo, I present to you a document entitled, Charge, Composition and Terms: the Strategic
Planning, Assessment, Analysis, and Review Committee of SUNY Old Westbury, as prepared by the
SPAAR Task Force and submitted on December 17, 2018 (please see attached).
I have no additions or changes to this document. I believe it stands as the very foundation we as a College
need to establish a Strategic Planning, Assessment, Analysis, and Review (hereafter: SPAAR) Committee
that will be responsible for monitoring progress towards the Collegeâ€™s strategic goals and objectives, as
detailed in the Strategic Plan.
I offer my gratitude to the SPAAR Task Force that worked diligently over the last few months,
demonstrating the excellent work that results from the collaborative efforts of a group nominated by the
President and the Faculty Senate.
I present this document today with the understanding that it is to be viewed by Faculty Senate. I welcome
questions or proposed revisions. I understand the next time the Faculty Senate will meet is on Friday,
February 1, 2019. Please provide me with responses following this meeting, or at least a status update.
I also ask that on behalf of the Faculty Senate, you send to the President's office the names of the six
initial candidates representing faculty and faculty governance as described in the document.
My hope is that we can have resolution on this, including the names of Committee nominees, by February
20, 2019. This will assure us that the SPAAR Committee will meet this semester and begin its work in
earnest.
I am encouraged by the spirit of trust that continues to develop and evolve in this ongoing Strategic
Planning process. Thank you for your persistent efforts.
