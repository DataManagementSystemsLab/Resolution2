Adjunct Action Form (AAF) and Salary Delays (Secretaries’ Meeting)
1.

Enrollment Thresholds: Courses are likely to be cancelled if they do not reach the following
thresholds
o

10 students for undergraduate courses

o

6 students for graduate courses

Academic Affairs asks, where and when possible, that forms be initiated by end of June for fall

semester appointments, and by the end ofthe fall semester for winter intersession and spring

appointments. In cases where early submissions are not possible (June 15% and December

13%), gently remind departmentchair that the adjunct action process optimally should be given
at least two weeks for continuing adjunct faculty and roughly one month for new adjunct
faculty.

Would like to keep adjunct in the previously assigned line number.

New Adjuncts: (potential bottlenecks — New Adjunct Faculty must be placed on an existing
adjunct faculty line #, preferably within a cluster, before requesting that a newline be
established if necessary; their course must meetthe enrollment threshold to haveit run,

whichin turn initiates the AAF& ARF processing)
o

Process requires that both the AAF (AA) and the Account Request Form (ARF) (ITS Form
— Banner)are initiated, once it has been determined that the course has adequate
enrollment to run. Please attach a copy of the ARF to the AAF. The AAF begins with the
DepartmentSecretary and Chair.
