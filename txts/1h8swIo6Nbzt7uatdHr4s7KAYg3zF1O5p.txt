Faculty Senate Chair Report 

Submitted by: Andrew Mattson

September 21, 2018



SPAAR Task Force Update:  Faculty governance has received a memo from the President regarding the SPAAR Task Force, which will create and charge the Strategic Planning, Assessment, Analysis, & Review Committee (SPAAR) to coordinate and monitor the implementation of the Strategic Plan.  

Action Item: Seven faculty nominees. President’s request: 7 nominees to fill 5 Task Force seats: 3 SAS, 2 SOB, 2 SOE. 

Senators: Are you or a member of your department willing to serve on the SPAAR Task Force and/or SPAAR Committee? 

Request to Change Senate Meeting Time:  Proposal: Change time to 2:00-4:00PM. 

“the current Faculty Senate and Full Faculty Senate meeting times conflicts with Friday afternoon prayer time (1pm - 2pm approximately) for Muslim faculty and staff members. As you may also know, Friday afternoon prayers are the equivalent of Saturday services for Jews and Sunday services for Christians. This results in effectively having Muslim colleagues unable to participate in a key meeting that is part of our shared governance mission and is counter to our social justice ideals.”

CAP: One Vacancy: Any SAS department except AS, CP, MA, PY, PE.     FS chair will contact PEL runner-up if needed (already one PEL on CAP.)
