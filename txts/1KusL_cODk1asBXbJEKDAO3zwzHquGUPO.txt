Resolution Regarding the SUNY Resource Allocation Tool, SUNY’s Mission, and Access to Higher
Education
Whereas, the proposed Resource Allocation Tool constitutes a goodwill effort by SUNY Central
Administration to stabilize campus funding and to enable individual campuses to engage in long-term
planning, given the reduced level of direct funding by the State of New York, and
Whereas, the proposed Resource Allocation Tool remains in its formative development and its
implementation will be subject to ongoing assessment and review regarding its effect on SUNY’s ability to
achieve its mission, and
Whereas, the faculty of SUNY recognize and value our role as advocates for fair access to quality public
higher education for all New Yorkers, but particularly for the socioeconomically disadvantaged and
underrepresented, and
Whereas, the cost of higher education at private institutions is prohibitive for large numbers of the State’s
citizens; for many students, there are no viable alternatives to SUNY, and
Whereas, that allocation from the State of New York has been decrease from a high of 81% in past years to
a current low of 19% burdening middle and lower income students alike in ways that discriminate against
those whose family incomes are lowest, and
Whereas, it is recognized that it is a real and ordinary economic condition for many socioeconomically
disadvantage and working class students to engage in full or part time employment while attending public
higher education, which necessarily increases time to graduation, so that a “nationally normed” metrics for
time to graduation does not match their reality, and
Whereas, the community and comprehensive colleges have institutional missions within the scope of SUNY
that serve a disproportionate number of socioeconomically disadvantaged and underrepresented New
Yorkers within the SUNY system,
Be it resolved that:
The Resource Allocation Tool be refined, in close consultation with appropriate representatives from
institutions serving socioeconomically disadvantaged and underrepresented New Yorkers, to ensure that
any and all metrics used for the determining the allocation of state funding contain mechanisms to ensure
that these important groups of New Yorkers continue to have access to a high quality education at SUNY,
with full recognition for the best practices involved in serving such students. The metrics used to allocate
State resources to SUNY campuses must include valid measures of the real and specific needs of these
students and of the institutions/faculty and staff who serve socioeconomically disadvantaged and
underrepresented New Yorkers.
And Be It Further Resolved that: the Chancellor and her staff along with representative members of all SUNY
units in an Emergency State Funding Task Force continue to actively advocate for an increase in state
funding commensurate with the needs of the SUNY system to meet demand and to support the diversity and
quality of it’s educational missions.
