KEY TAKEAWAYS
 The survey captured a broad range of remote instruction experiences among OW
faculty. Some find remote instruction to be highly effective, while others continue to find
it hard to adapt. Most faculty seem to consider remote teaching to be a workable and
preferable option under the circumstance, while increased workload, reduced student
engagement, and students’ technology issues pose challenges.
 Most faculty feel offering courses on campus in a “COVID-safe” mode would not
necessarily make teaching more effective, considering safety concerns, added anxiety,
and the burden of following safety protocols and dual-mode instruction.
 Effective interpersonal communication is harder in remote settings. Respondents
indicated that keeping students engaged, assessing the level of learning, maintaining
academic honesty and offering individualized support to students are more challenging
in the remote setting.
 Faculty feel that enhanced IT support and a space on campus for students to study with
computers and reliable internet will improve remote instruction experience, by providing
stability to instruction and curtailing students’ technology issues. Clear guidelines from the
College, peer-mentoring/exchange, and training in remote pedagogy may also help.
However, faculty also identify e-communication/training overload as issues.

WHO RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY
Data were collected using an e-survey during October 22-30, 2020. All SUNY OW faculty
teaching at least one remote course in Fall 2020 were invited to participate in the survey.

I.

REMOTE TEACHING EXPERIENCE

While survey respondents express a range of experiences in and sentiments toward remote
instruction, overall, they appear to be adapting well to the remote instruction experience.
Respondents rated their remote instruction experiences in Fall 2020 on the scale of 1(Extremely
Unsatisfactory) to 5 (Extremely Satisfactory). The average rating is 3.68.
Narrative comments indicate that, in general, respondents consider remote instruction to be
the most workable or desirable option under the circumstances, despite some challenges. They
note technical problems and the low level of student engagement as areas of dissatisfaction.
Some specifically note frequent problems with the Portal and students not turning on their video
cameras. Those who are more satisfied with remote instruction tend to report a high level of
student engagement in their courses, the assurance of safety during the pandemic, and the
lack of a commute. Effectiveness of synchronous meeting platforms (Zoom, Blackboard Ultra) is
also noted. See Q3OA in F20 Mid Semester Remote Instruction Faculty Survey: Open-Ended
Responses for more narrative comments.

AREAS OF CHALLENGE

Most respondents identify that “keeping students engaged” became more challenging after
the transition to remote instruction. A majority of respondents also feel that assessing students’
understanding, preparing for classes, ensuring academic honesty, and providing individualized
support also became more challenging.

AREAS OF CONCERN

Respondents identify the increased amount of work, low levels of student engagement, and
students’ technology problems as major areas of concern in remote instruction.
Other concerns include Blackboard problems, the increased non-academic responsibilities of
students, and the burdens of increased amounts of communication, service, and training on
faculty. For more, see Q6OA in F20 Mid Semester Remote Instruction Faculty Survey: OpenEnded Responses.

IV.

RESOURCES NEEDED

Faculty feel that the strongest needs are for enhanced IT support and the availability of a study
space on campus for students, with computers and Internet connection. Guidelines from the
College that clarify expectations for remote instruction, opportunities for pedagogical
discussions with other faculty, and training in remote/online pedagogies may also help to
enhance the quality of remote instruction. However, narrative comments indicate that the
increased amount of work makes it difficult to spend time on training. See Q8OA in F20 Mid
Semester Remote Instruction Faculty Survey: Open-Ended Responses for additional resource
suggestions.

experience?

V. WOULD “COVID-SAFE” CLASSROOMS BE MORE EFFECTIVE?
Most respondents indicate that their remote courses would not necessarily be more effective if
they were taught on campus.
Those who believe that on-campus instruction would make their courses more effective (“Yes”
in Figure 5) note that face-to-face interactions would help with engaging students, working on
hands-on activities, and assessing students’ learning.
Skeptics (“Maybe”/ “No”) tend to express safety concerns. For example, one faculty notes “I
don't believe our college has the resources to properly ensure Covid [sic] safety. Hubris could
cost lives. I want to return -- but not without knowing we have the resources and the will to
carry out safety.” Others indicate that safety protocols would offset the benefit of face-to-face
meeting (e.g., “I feel that the social distancing and mask wearing will have a similar level of
negative impact on the learning experience as teaching remotely does”) and expect low
levels of face-to-face student attendance (e.g., “Even if precautions are taken, it is unlikely
students will show up in large numbers as long as the pandemic persists“). Faculty are also
concerned about the challenge of dual-mode teaching (e.g., “I feel like combining remote
and live will be even more work and adaptation”; “Simultaneously teaching a combo of virtual
and live students is impossible in an active classroom learning/ teaching style. The teaching
strategies are so different“). Effectiveness of remote instruction is also noted (e.g., “I actually
think that remote is better if done the right way”). See F20 Mid Semester Remote Instruction
Faculty Survey: Open-Ended Responses for more narrative comments.

Q9. Do you think your remote courses would be more effective if they could be taught on campus under
a "COVID-safe" condition? This condition would include social distancing, mask wearing guidelines, and
the combination of on-campus and virtual meetings.
