To help faculty and administrators institutions make the right design choices,

EAB developed the Market Alignment Checklist, which lays out key

questions to consider when designing (or revitalizing) a program.

Additional resources to help institutions avoid the most
damaging program launch mistakes

For assistance in overcoming miscalculations in market demand potential,
program design, and costs, use EAB’s program launch resources on
