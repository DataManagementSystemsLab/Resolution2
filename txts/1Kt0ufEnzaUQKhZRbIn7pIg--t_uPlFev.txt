This form should be used to seek SUNY’s approval and the State Education
Department’s (SED) registration of a proposed new academic program leading
to a graduate degree in teacher education at the initial/professional or
professional level and relevant extensions or annotations.  Approval and
registration are both required before a proposed program can be promoted or
advertised, or can enroll students.  The campus Chief Executive or Chief
Academic Officer should send a signed cover letter and this completed form,
including required appended items, as a single, continuously paginated
document to the SUNY Provost at program.review@suny.edu.[1]  External
Evaluation Reports from each evaluator and a single Institutional Response
should also be sent, but in a separate electronic document.  Additional
information is available in the Guide to Academic Program Planning for
Educator Preparation Programs.

|2.2 Program Description, Purposes and Planning                                       |

Insert the program description as it will appear in the institution’s
catalog.

Old Westbury’s Master of Science in Literacy Education programs are
designed as paths to initial (including initial/professional) certification
in Literacy at either the childhood (B-6) or adolescence (5-12) levels, or
both.  These degrees are designed for educators who already possess
initial, professional, or permanent certification in Childhood, Middle
Childhood, or Adolescence Education and who are seeking professional
certification and/or an advanced degree in Literacy Education.  These
programs combine theory and practice and meet all relevant New York State
Education Department professional certification requirements.  Each 30-
credit program (39 credits for the combined Childhood and Adolescence
program) has a 15-credit core that includes pedagogical content in
literacy, language acquisition, assessment, literacy coaching, and
leadership, all based on current research in the field.  The remaining 15
credits include specialized coursework in Childhood or Adolescent Literacy
including literature studies, literacy practices and strategies for the
content areas, writing, and a supervised practicum.

Candidates seeking admission to these programs must meet the following
requirements: (1) an undergraduate degree in Education; (2) a minimum
cumulative GPA of 3.0 (on a 4 point scale) in their highest earned degree;
(3) initial, professional, or permanent certification in Childhood, Middle
Childhood, or Adolescence Education; (4) two letters of recommendation, at
least one from an academic source; (5) an entrance writing sample; and (6)
submission of a GRE test score.

The program will be offered for  part-time  students  only.  Candidates  who
take two courses per semester can complete the program in  two  and  a  half
years (5 semesters).  The combined program will take candidates three  years
(6 semesters) to complete.

What are the program’s primary student learning outcomes (SLOs)?

NOTE:  SLOs are defined by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education
in the Characteristics of Excellence in Higher Education as “clearly
articulated written statements, expressed in observable terms, of key
learning outcomes: the knowledge, skills and competencies that students are
expected to exhibit upon completion of the program.”
How does the program relate to the institution and SUNY’s mission and
strategic goals and priorities?  What is the proposed program’s importance
to the institution, its relationship to existing and/or projected programs,
and its expected impact on them?  As applicable, how does the program
reflect diversity and/or international perspectives?

Specialization in Literacy Education is important to teachers in our region
and the state.  The degree programs address growing concerns in New York
State about the literacy skills of students at the elementary, middle, and
high school levels.  The proposed Master of Science degrees will provide
paths to initial/professional certification in Literacy Education for
Childhood and Adolescence.  The programs are appropriate for recent
graduates who have completed requirements for initial teacher certification
at the undergraduate level, as well as for experienced teachers who seek
certification in Literacy Education and an advanced degree.  Our degrees
combine theory and practice, and meet all relevant New York State Education
Department (NYSED) certification requirements and include the Common Core
Standards.  These degrees will bring new, affordable, accessible graduate
education options to residents of central and western Long Island and of
the New York metropolitan region.


The program’s primary student learning outcomes include:
    • Developing literacy leaders who have specialized pedagogical tools to
      increase literacy skills in both childhood and adolescence in the
      areas of digital literacies, literacy assessment, and various content
      area strategies and will serve in school settings as reading specials,
      literacy coaches, and classroom teachers
    • Developing literacy specialists who will enhance literacy programs
      through their pedagogical knowledge, practices, and integration of
      technologies across curriculum, and communicate information about
      literacy to school personnel and parents/caregivers
    • Encouraging an appreciation for culturally diverse cultures and
      literature in graduating reading specialists who promote social
      justice
    • Increasing knowledge of learning differences in the areas of speaking,
      listening, writing, and reading
    • Developing literacy coaches who will provide instruction and
      assessment for students in need of literacy support

How were faculty members (education and arts and sciences) involved in the
program’s design?  Also describe input by external partners; e.g., P-12
schools, community college partners.

Current faculty who hold reading certification and will teach these
graduate classes collaborated on the proposed program’s design.  Faculty
worked together to design syllabi and a proposed course sequence to best
prepare our future graduate literacy candidates.

A survey was distributed to local school districts asking them what
graduate programs would produce graduates that they are in need of hiring.
The overwhelming majority indicated that they need more teachers with a
degree in literacy education, both at the childhood and adolescence levels.

Enter anticipated enrollments for Years 1 through 5 in the table below.
How were they determined, and what assumptions were used?  What
contingencies exist if anticipated enrollments are not achieved?

The following tables outline the anticipated enrollment for the three
programs.  These numbers were determined based on the interest of our
current undergraduate students in Childhood, Special, and Adolescence
Education who are seeking to pursue a graduate degree in the specialization
of Literacy Education.  We believe much of our graduate enrollment will
stem from our current undergraduate students who have voiced their interest
these programs.  If anticipated enrollments are not achieved, we will work
to advertise these programs more widely and actively recruit initially
certified teachers from the local school districts with whom we work.

Program Impact on SUNY and New York State:
Need: What is the need for the proposed program in terms of the clientele
it will serve and the educational and/or economic needs of the area and New
York State?  How was need determined?  Why are similar programs, if any,
not meeting the need?

   An area as large and diverse as Long Island should have at least one
   public institution providing graduate programs in these specializations
   for its students/residents. These Masters degrees will provide
   affordable, accessible, regional programs for the talented, energetic,
   and value conscious residents of Long Island and metropolitan New York.
   These new degree programs will help educators who need continuing
   education opportunities for their careers and will also help teachers
   with initial or provisional certifications who need to meet certification
   requirements.


      More affordable and accessible high-quality Masters degrees in
      education will be beneficial for both the Long Island residents who
      gain these degrees and for New York State’s economy.
    • Tuition costs for a Masters degree in education at a Long Island
      private college or university currently average over $32,000. A
      comparable SUNY graduate degree costs less than half as much
      ($12,500).

    • Old Westbury would be the only public institution on Long Island
      offering M.S. degrees in Childhood Literacy Education and Adolescence
      Literacy Education. The ability to study these subjects at a public
      college will ease the financial burden the acquisition of such degrees
      now places on talented but less affluent students in this region.

    • According to the New York State Department of Labor website, in 2011 a
      Master’s degree added $11,492 to a New York State worker’s salary. New
      York State workers with Master’s degrees earned an average of $69,992
      per year.[4]

      Old Westbury’s diverse campus community, its 40-year history of
      fostering racial and intercultural understanding, and the School of
      Education’s commitment to this mission, puts the college and SOE in an
      excellent position to train teachers for urban and metropolitan
      schools and for the mixed cultural communities of Long Island.
    • The Provost’s 2001 Advisory Council on Teacher Education called for
      SUNY to provide more teachers for the state’s urban school districts.
      The Council’s report noted that the City University of New York (CUNY)
      was providing only one quarter of teachers needed by New York City.[5]

    • In 2010-2011 in New York City, the New York State Education Department
      reported 12% of all Reading & Literacy teaching assignments were held
      by teachers without appropriate certification.[6]

      There is general agreement among education professionals that New York
      State’s public school system needs literacy education professionals.
    • In a 2004 report, scholars writing for the Carnegie Corporation noted
      the central importance of literacy for students today and pointed out
      that an estimated 8 million students between fourth and 12th grade
      struggle to read at grade level.[7] The New York State Regents, in
      response to this and other reports, are considering the design of a
      statewide adolescent literacy plan.[8]

   Although 11 SUNY campuses offer comparable degrees in Literacy, not one
   of these schools is on Long Island. Within SUNY the nearest comparable
   programs are at New Paltz, a college 100 miles distance from Long Island,
   clearly beyond commuting distance for Long Island residents.

Similar Programs: Use the table below to list similar programs at public
and independent institutions in the service area, region and state, as
appropriate.  Expand the table as needed. NOTE:  Detailed program-level
information for SUNY institutions is available in the Academic Program
Enterprise System (APES) or Academic Program Dashboards.  Institutional
research and information security officers at your campus should be able to
help provide access to these password-protected sites.  Non-SUNY program
titles and degree information – but no enrollment data – is available from
SED’s Inventory of Registered Programs.

Collaboration:  In what ways did this program’s design benefit from
consultation with other SUNY campuses?

Programs at other SUNY campuses were researched in designing this program.
There was consultation with Dr. Virginia Goatley from SUNY Albany in making
the courses literacy specific, covering all aspects of the field.

Concerns or Objections: If concerns and/or objections were raised by other
SUNY campuses, how were they resolved?

There were no concerns or objections.
|2.3  Admissions                                                                     |

a) Identify all institutional admission requirements and all program
   admission requirements.  A mandatory admission requirement for candidates
   seeking professional or permanent certificates is that they hold an
   initial certificate in the same certificate title.

      Initially, we will accept applications only for the fall semesters. A
      Graduate Admissions Committee, composed of the Graduate Program
      Director and the Literacy Education Graduate Programs Coordinator will
      evaluate applications.

|Initial, professional, or permanent teacher certification   |
|An undergraduate or graduate degree in Education, or related|
|field, with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 (on a scale of  |
|4) or the equivalent, in the highest earned degree          |
|Two letters of recommendation, at least one from an academic|
|source                                                      |

|including the following TOEFL scores: paper exam = 550;     |
|computer exam= 213; Internet exam= 80. Students taking the  |
|IELTS English (Cambridge) exams must pass with a broad band |
|score of 6.5. Students must also have their overseas        |
|documents evaluated by AACRAO International or WES (World   |
|Education Services).                                        |

b) What is the process for evaluating exceptions to those requirements?


      There are no exceptions to these requirements.

c) How will the institution encourage enrollment in this program by persons
   from groups historically underrepresented in the institution, discipline
   or occupation?


   We will offer a diversity scholarship to one student each year from the
   literacy program, just as our other current graduate programs do.
   Additionally, we will actively recruit candidates through school
   districts, specifically targeting districts with a large number of
   underrepresented teachers who have yet to pursue their graduate degrees.


|2.4  Academic and Other Support Services                                            |


a) Summarize the academic advising and support services available to help
   students succeed in the program.

      Academic advising is an essential component of these programs.  The
      advisor will serve as a primary source of information and support
      during the students’ tenure in the programs. The advisor serves as a
      mentor in relation to career planning, plans for future study,
      academic progress and other issues that impact students’ performance
      in the programs. Candidates will be expected to meet regularly with
      advisors during each semester. Such meetings will provide
      opportunities for both in-depth discussion of personal experiences,
      including the application of theory to practice and the implications
      of research, and the exploration of technique and professional
      identity development.


      Students will have access to the full range of services provided by
      the School of Education and the college. Some of the services include
      newly renovated classrooms, new reference materials in newly renovated
      library, and a Curriculum Materials Center. The SOE also has a
      Microcomputer-Based Laboratory Learning and Teaching Resource Center
      designed to engage candidates and teachers in inquiry and process
      skills in laboratory activities in the life and the physical sciences.
      Opportunities are provided for students to develop inquiry-based
      curricula that use math, science, and technology to enhance science
      content knowledge.

      Old Westbury’s School of Education has in place a Director of Field
      Experience and Clinical Services. The SOE currently has ongoing
      arrangements for practice teaching and practicum, including sites for
      observation and for student teaching, in 36 districts on Long Island
      and in all 5 boroughs of New York City. School of Education staff work
      closely with staff at the SUNY Urban Teaching Center (SUTEC) for New
      York City placements. These arrangements will provide sufficient and
      appropriate placement opportunities to develop the practicum component
      of this program as it grows.


b) Describe types, amounts and sources of student financial support
   anticipated.  Indicate the proportion of the student body receiving each
   type of support, including those receiving no support.


      There are no special provisions for financial support for students.
      Tuition will be the standard SUNY graduate student amount. Students
      will be eligible for all financial aid programs available for graduate
      study, including the SUNY Graduate Diversity Fellowship Program.



|2.5 Prior Learning Assessment                                                       |


If this program will grant credit based on Prior Learning Assessment,
describe the methods of evaluating the learning and the maximum number of
credits allowed, or check here [ X ] if not applicable.


|2.6 Program Assessment and Improvement                                              |

Describe how this program’s achievement of its objectives will be assessed
in accordance with SUNY policy, including the date of the program’s initial
assessment and the length (in years) of the assessment cycle.  Explain
plans for assessing achievement of students’ learning outcomes during the
program and success after completion of the program.

The School of Education will be reviewed by CAEP in Fall 2019.  These
degrees in Literacy Education will be part of this review, one that happens
every seven years.  In addition, we will have a SPA review through the
International Literacy Association (ILA).  In order to complete the
required self-studies, assessment data will be collected from specific
assignments based on the specific CAEP and SPA standards and program
learning outcomes, analyzed, and used for continuous program improvement.

Summarize the analysis of library collection resources and needs for this
program by the collection librarian and program faculty.  Include an
assessment of existing library resources and accessibility to those
resources for students enrolled in the program in all formats, including
the institution’s implementation of SUNY Connect, the SUNY-wide electronic
library program.

Students will have access to the full range of services provided by the
School of Education and the college. Some of the services include newly
renovated classrooms, new reference materials in the library, and a
Curriculum Materials Center. The SOE also has a Microcomputer-Based
Laboratory Learning and Teaching Resource Center designed to engage
candidates and teachers in inquiry and process skills in laboratory
activities in the life and the physical sciences. Opportunities are
provided for students to develop inquiry-based curricula that use math,
science, and technology to enhance science content knowledge.

CATALOG DESCRIPTION

This course engages the teacher practitioner in examining literacy as an
evolving language process among his or her students.  Theories of oral
language acquisition, reading and writing acquisition, the stages of
literacy learning, and the role of standards and benchmarks in literacy
instruction will be addressed. Reading selections and reflective writing
focus on personal literacies, the interrelationships of language, culture,
and schooling, and major thinkers in the field of literacy education.

RELATIONSHIP TO CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

            The School of Education’s goal is to prepare competent
effective teacher candidates who fulfill leadership roles primarily but not
exclusively in their schools and the education community at large.
Consequently, the School of Education places considerable emphasis on the
development of knowledge, skills and dispositions to enhance its graduates’
leadership performance in the classroom, the school and the profession. The
SOE has adopted the following overreaching principles which link its vision
and mission to those of the college and the profession of teaching.

            ➢ A commitment to preparing teachers as professionals
            ➢ An active engagement in promoting a just world
            ➢ A belief in the inter disciplinary nature of knowledge and
              justice

COURSE OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES

 Candidates will:
    • develop an in-depth  understanding  of  literacy  and  how  proficient
      reading works (ILA 1.1, I.2, 1.3)
    • discuss the theories of language acquisition and how these
      perspectives influence curriculum/instruction. (ILA 1.1, I.2, 1.3,
      2.1)
    • demonstrate the natural context for learning and using language and
      the
     language-centered activities for children in the academic environment.
     (ILA 2.1, 2.2, 2.3)
     develop opportunities for children to use language and literacy for
     real purposes and audiences. (ILA 2.1, 2.2, 2.3)
     present an approach to early reading instruction based on the
     reading/writing connections and the child’s need to know. (ILA 2.1,
     2.2, 2.3)
     model the components of a balanced literacy program, including an
     assessment that will inform the reading/writing curriculum. (ILA 1.1,
     2.1, 3.2)
    • articulate specific literacy strategies for culturally and
      linguistically diverse learners with special needs. Associate these
      strategies with the interdisciplinary practices of instruction. (ILA
      4.1, 4.2, 4.3)
    • implement an on-going assessment to determine what learners know and
      can do. This information will be shared with parents so that they
      continue their role as partners in literacy development (ILA 3.1,3.2,
      3.3, 3.4)

METHODS OF INSTRUCTION
Lecture, required readings, discussions collaborative groups, presentations

STATEMENT OF PROFESSIONALISM

The School of Education (SOE) provides candidates with preparation  for  the
teaching profession.  It is important that candidates  realize  expectations
on the part of the  Education  faculty  regarding  professionalism.   It  is
critical that candidates of programs at the  SOE  understand  the  behaviors
associated with professionalism both in class and in the field.

Professionalism is demonstrated when candidates:  a) attend all  classes  on
time, b) attend all classes, c)  are  prepared  for  class  discussions,  d)
submit all assignments on due dates, and e) establish positive  interactions
with the instructor and with other classmates.

Professionalism also applies to the decorum displayed by candidates  in  the
field.  This includes, in addition to the above, dressing appropriately  for
the work setting and  demonstrating  at  all  times  professional  behavior,
including  knowledge   of   the   practices   and   laws   that   apply   to
confidentiality.

STATEMENT ON PLAGIARISM

Plagiarism is "passing off" the  work  of  others  as  if  it  is  our  own.
Whether we directly quote a source or paraphrase  it,  the  source  must  be
properly referenced.  This includes a textual reference  and  a  listing  in
the list of references at the end  of  a  paper.   Additionally,  plagiarism
includes the wholesale lifting of large quotes, as well as paraphrasing  too
closely the actual words of the original author.

Plagiarism is also the copying of another student's work;  after  all,  this
is not your work.  Even though some feel it is easy to  mask  this  type  of
plagiarism, this is not usually so.  Plagiarism is a  serious  offense.   In
the publishing field, it is the source of many lawsuits.  In  the  classroom
context, it is considered a form of cheating.   If  it  can  be  established
that a paper contains plagiarism, it will be returned with no credit  given.
 More serious penalties may occur depending on  the  degree  of  plagiarism,
including failure in the paper and/or failure in the course.

We will discuss the proper methods of citing published material.   You  must
use APA format for citations and references.  This format can be also  found
in the Publication Manual of  the  American  Psychological  Association,  as
well as on-line.  You are responsible for using this format in  all  written
work that requires citations, whether the material  is  quoted  directly  or
paraphrased.

ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS:

learning disability that may impact your course work, please contact The

RELATIONSHIP TO CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The School of Education’s goal is to prepare competent and effective
candidates who fulfill leadership roles primarily but not exclusively in
their schools and the education community at large. Consequently, the
School of Education places considerable emphasis on the development of
knowledge, skills and dispositions to enhance its graduates’ leadership
performance in the classroom, the school and the profession. The SOE has
adopted the following overreaching principles which link its vision and
mission to those of the college and the profession of teaching:

    • A commitment to maintaining a professional community of teachers and
      learners
    • An active engagement in supporting practitioners as promoters of a
      just world
    • An interdisciplinary approach to knowledge and practice

COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND ASSESSMENTS/EVALUATIONS

As students in the MS program, you will be expected to reference your own
classroom experiences in each of the assignments.

 1. Attendance & Participation: In order to receive full credit you need to
 be punctual and have perfect attendance. All assignments need to be
 submitted on time. Class participation is defined not as the most frequent
 responses but as the most meaningful contributions to the discussion.
 2. Lesson Plan – Students will have the opportunity to create a lesson
 plan that incorporates differentiated instruction for a class of diverse
 learners.  Special attention will be paid to the modifications and
 adaptations you will use for the learners.
 3. Response Papers: You are responsible handing in a brief paper (3-5
 typed, double-spaced pages) after reading each assigned book.  This is a
 response paper that should include your thoughts, questions, concerns, and
 connections to the readings.  It is appropriate to include your own
 teaching experiences within your writing.
 4.  IEP Analysis and Strategy:  You will be given a sample IEP (Individual
 Educational Plan) and develop an appropriate plan of action to help
 students reach literacy goals.  You must use research to support your best
 practices.
 5.  Common Core and Special Education Project:  It is important to
 understand the Common Core ELA standards and their relationship to
 exceptional learners. In this project, you will use your lesson plans and
 sample IEP to write an essay on the connections between the Common Core
 Standards, exceptional learners, and the ways that diverse learners could
 meet the standards.





A rubric will be used to assess all requirements. The specific requirements
for each activity will be defined in the rubric.

STATEMENT OF PROFESSIONALISM

The School of Education (SOE) provides candidates with preparation for the
teaching profession.  It is important that candidates realize expectations
on the part of the Education faculty regarding professionalism.  It is
critical that candidates of programs at the SOE understand the behaviors
associated with professionalism both in class and in the field.

Professionalism is demonstrated when candidates:  a) attend all classes on
time, b) attend all classes, c) are prepared for class discussions, d)
submit all assignments on due dates, and e) establish positive interactions
with the instructor and with other classmates.

Professionalism also applies to the decorum displayed by candidates in the
field.  This includes, in addition to the above, dressing appropriately for
the work setting and demonstrating at all times professional behavior,
including knowledge of the practices and laws that apply to
confidentiality.

STATEMENT ON PLAGIARISM

Plagiarism is "passing off" the work of others as if it is our own.
Whether we directly quote a source or paraphrase it, the source must be
properly referenced.  This includes a textual reference and a listing in
the list of references at the end of a paper.  Additionally, plagiarism
includes the wholesale lifting of large quotes, as well as paraphrasing too
closely the actual words of the original author.

Plagiarism is also the copying of another student's work; after all, this
is not your work.  Even though some feel it is easy to mask this type of
plagiarism, this is not usually so.  Plagiarism is a serious offense.  In
the publishing field, it is the source of many lawsuits.  In the classroom
context, it is considered a form of cheating.  If it can be established
that a paper contains plagiarism, it will be returned with no credit given.
 More serious penalties may occur depending on the degree of plagiarism,
including failure in the paper and/or failure in the course.

We will discuss the proper methods of citing published material.  You must
use APA format for citations and references.  This format can be also found
in the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, as
well as on-line.  You are responsible for using this format in all written
work that requires citations, whether the material is quoted directly or
paraphrased.

ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS:

If you have or suspect you may have a physical, psychological, medical or
learning disability that may impact your course work, please contact The
Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (OSSD), Phone: 516-876-

COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND ASSESSMENTS/EVALUATIONS

As students in the MS program, you will be expected to reference your own
classroom experiences in each of the assignments.

 1. Attendance & Participation: In order to receive full credit you need to
 be punctual and have perfect attendance. All assignments need to be
 submitted on time. Class participation is defined not as the most frequent
 responses but as the most meaningful contributions to the discussion.
 2. NAEP Worksheet – Follow instructions for the NAEP worksheet.
 3. DIBELS Worksheet: Follow instructions for the DIBELS worksheet.
 4.  EngageNY Website Activity:  Follow instructions for the EngageNY
 worksheet.
 5.  Observation Survey: Select a focus student and administer the
 Observation Survey.  Include all the survey components in addition to a
 completed form, “An Analysis of the Child’s Strategic Activity.”
 6. Qualitative Reading Inventory:  Select a student upon whom you want to
 conduct the QRI-5.  Administer the assessment to a student in grades 2-10.
  You must administer it according to the appropriately suggested
 developmental guidelines.  Be sure to administer it in accordance to the
 guidelines for determining an independent, instructional, and frustration
 level.  Analyze the assessments you’ve collected.
 7. Word Study Analysis: Analyze a spelling inventory that you administer
 to one student who is in grades 1 through 7. (If you are selecting an
 older student, you should select a student with decoding difficulties.)
 Identify this student’s spelling stage. Justify your decision-what can
 your student do successfully, what is the student using but confusing,
 what is beyond the student’s current level of awareness? What content is
 appropriate for this student’s spelling curriculum? Use the scope and
 sequence chart to map out the sequence of instruction for the next 3
 weeks. Create 3 actual word lists for instruction.
 8.  Writing Assessment Project: Score and analyze one piece of writing
 from a student against the evaluative criteria (rubrics) found on EngageNY
 within the grade level assessment manuals.  Write an analysis of the
 writing.
 9.  Reflection Papers:  You are responsible handing in a brief paper (3-5
 typed, double-spaced pages) after reading each assigned book.  This is a
 response paper that should include your thoughts, questions, concerns, and
 connections to the readings.  It is appropriate to include your own
 teaching experiences within your writing.


A rubric will be used to assess all requirements. The specific requirements
for each activity will be defined in the rubric.

STATEMENT OF PROFESSIONALISM

The School of Education (SOE) provides candidates with preparation for the
teaching profession.  It is important that candidates realize expectations
on the part of the Education faculty regarding professionalism.  It is
critical that candidates of programs at the SOE understand the behaviors
associated with professionalism both in class and in the field.

Professionalism is demonstrated when candidates:  a) attend all classes on
time, b) attend all classes, c) are prepared for class discussions, d)
submit all assignments on due dates, and e) establish positive interactions
with the instructor and with other classmates.

Professionalism also applies to the decorum displayed by candidates in the
field.  This includes, in addition to the above, dressing appropriately for
the work setting and demonstrating at all times professional behavior,
including knowledge of the practices and laws that apply to
confidentiality.

STATEMENT ON PLAGIARISM

Plagiarism is "passing off" the work of others as if it is our own.
Whether we directly quote a source or paraphrase it, the source must be
properly referenced.  This includes a textual reference and a listing in
the list of references at the end of a paper.  Additionally, plagiarism
includes the wholesale lifting of large quotes, as well as paraphrasing too
closely the actual words of the original author.

Plagiarism is also the copying of another student's work; after all, this
is not your work.  Even though some feel it is easy to mask this type of
plagiarism, this is not usually so.  Plagiarism is a serious offense.  In
the publishing field, it is the source of many lawsuits.  In the classroom
context, it is considered a form of cheating.  If it can be established
that a paper contains plagiarism, it will be returned with no credit given.
 More serious penalties may occur depending on the degree of plagiarism,
including failure in the paper and/or failure in the course.

We will discuss the proper methods of citing published material.  You must
use APA format for citations and references.  This format can be also found
in the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, as
well as on-line.  You are responsible for using this format in all written
work that requires citations, whether the material is quoted directly or
paraphrased.

COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND ASSESSMENTS/EVALUATIONS

As students in the MS program, you will be expected to reference your own
classroom experiences in each of the assignments.

 1. Attendance & Participation: In order to receive full credit you need to
 be punctual and  have perfect attendance. All assignments need to be
 submitted on time. Class participation is defined not as the most frequent
 responses but as the most meaningful contributions to the discussion.
 2. Coaches’ Notebook - Participants in this coaching course  will  keep  a
 notebook to help each other better understand  how  to  think,  work,  and
 communicate in our roles as coaches. Your Coaches' Notebook  should  be  a
 place for you to record ideas, thoughts, language, and connections as  you
 work to make sense of your life as facilitator,  teacher,  and  coach.  It
 should  enrich  your  personal  life  by  helping  you  capture   critical
 incidents, slow down and look  closely  and,  through  your  own  writing,
 uncover what matters to you and the teachers you work with.
 3. Response Papers: You are responsible handing in a brief paper (3-5
 typed, double-spaced pages) after reading each assigned book.  This is a
 response paper that should include your thoughts, questions, concerns, and
 connections to the readings.  It is appropriate to include your own
 teaching experiences within your writing.


 4. Video Tapes: You will engage in several small group  experiences  where
 you explore coaching, Using teacher and coaching video  tapes  (tapes  you
 create), you will work in pairs  (one  coach,  one  teacher)  to  set  up,
 conduct, and debrief as you would in a teacher classroom visit.  The  tape
 should be between 15-20 minutes in length where the teacher is  conducting
 a literacy experience (read aloud, shared reading, etc.). Tape 1 is a tape
 of you teaching a lesson. Tape 2 is a tape of you working with  a  teacher
 in a demonstration/coaching experience. The coach in each experience  will
 lead the reflection and analysis session. After  the  session,  the  group
 observing as well as the coach/teacher pair will discuss  lessons  learned
 about coaching and identify critical  insights  about  growth  and  future
 goals. You may pose questions that you want to discuss,  or  raise  issues
 that you might pursue through professional reading.
 5. Coaching Analysis Paper: Using your notes and your exit slips, do a
 reflection piece   analyzing where you were (as a coach) when the course
 began, what important shifts in thinking and acting as a coach occurred
 during the course, and where you see yourself going over the next year as
 you work as a coach in your school. Establish a few reachable goals for
 areas you’d like to grow as a result of experiences you had within this
 course.
6. Exit Slips: Students will reflect on their own “Connections, Insights”
and “Questions, New anomalies,” their reading, and reflections about
coaching.

A rubric will be used to assess all requirements. The specific requirements
for each activity will be defined in the rubric.

STATEMENT OF PROFESSIONALISM

The School of Education (SOE) provides candidates with preparation for the
teaching profession.  It is important that candidates realize expectations
on the part of the Education faculty regarding professionalism.  It is
critical that candidates of programs at the SOE understand the behaviors
associated with professionalism both in class and in the field.

Professionalism is demonstrated when candidates:  a) attend all classes on
time, b) attend all classes, c) are prepared for class discussions, d)
submit all assignments on due dates, and e) establish positive interactions
with the instructor and with other classmates.

Professionalism also applies to the decorum displayed by candidates in the
field.  This includes, in addition to the above, dressing appropriately for
the work setting and demonstrating at all times professional behavior,
including knowledge of the practices and laws that apply to
confidentiality.

STATEMENT ON PLAGIARISM

Plagiarism is "passing off" the work of others as if it is our own.
Whether we directly quote a source or paraphrase it, the source must be
properly referenced.  This includes a textual reference and a listing in
the list of references at the end of a paper.  Additionally, plagiarism
includes the wholesale lifting of large quotes, as well as paraphrasing too
closely the actual words of the original author.

Plagiarism is also the copying of another student's work; after all, this
is not your work.  Even though some feel it is easy to mask this type of
plagiarism, this is not usually so.  Plagiarism is a serious offense.  In
the publishing field, it is the source of many lawsuits.  In the classroom
context, it is considered a form of cheating.  If it can be established
that a paper contains plagiarism, it will be returned with no credit given.
 More serious penalties may occur depending on the degree of plagiarism,
including failure in the paper and/or failure in the course.

We will discuss the proper methods of citing published material.  You must
use APA format for citations and references.  This format can be also found
in the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, as
well as on-line.  You are responsible for using this format in all written
work that requires citations, whether the material is quoted directly or
paraphrased.

ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS:

If you have or suspect you may have a physical, psychological, medical or
learning disability that may impact your course work, please contact The
Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (OSSD), Phone: 516-876-
3009, Fax: 516-876-3005, TTD: 516-876-3083. The Office will help you

RELATIONSHIP TO CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
             The School of Education’s goal is to prepare competent
effective teacher candidates who fulfill leadership roles primarily but not
exclusively in their schools and the education community at large.
Consequently, the School of Education places considerable emphasis on the
development of knowledge, skills and dispositions to enhance its graduates’
leadership performance in the classroom, the school and the profession. The
SOE has adopted the following overreaching principles which link its vision
and mission to those of the college and the profession of teaching.

            ➢ A commitment to preparing teachers as professionals
            ➢ An active engagement in promoting a just world
            ➢ A belief in the interdisciplinary nature of knowledge and
              justice

COURSE OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES
Candidates will:
    • develop a critical approach in the understanding and selection of
      children’s literature. This approach should reference the mores and
      cultural aspects of society. Consider the roots of censorship (ALA
      position paper). (ILA 1.2, 2.3, 4.2)
    • demonstrate the need to use multicultural literature to build, bridge,
      and broaden the common elements of literature. Consider an
      interdisciplinary approach. (ILA 2.2, 2.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3)
    • discuss the concept of genre in children’s literature that emphasis
      different elements. Relate this concept to language and cultural
      differences. (ILA 2.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3)
    • model reading aloud to children and cite how this experience relates
      to creating life-long readers and writers.  Discuss the objectives for
      reading: pleasure, understanding, character development, vicarious
      experiences, or to reveal society. (ILA 2.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3)
    • articulate the need to apply critical standards to children’s
      literature. (ILA 2.1, 4.1, 4.3)


METHODS OF INSTRUCTION
Lecture, required readings, discussions collaborative groups, presentations
and technology instruction and performance.

STATEMENT OF PROFESSIONALISM


The School of Education (SOE) provides candidates with preparation for the
teaching profession.  It is important that candidates realize expectations
on the part of the Education faculty regarding professionalism.  It is
critical that candidates of programs at the SOE understand the behaviors
associated with professionalism both in class and in the field.

Professionalism is demonstrated when candidates:  a) attend all classes on
time, b) attend all classes, c) are prepared for class discussions, d)
submit all assignments on due dates, and e) establish positive interactions
with the instructor and with other classmates.

Professionalism also applies to the decorum displayed by candidates in the
field.  This includes, in addition to the above, dressing appropriately for
the work setting and demonstrating at all times professional behavior,
including knowledge of the practices and laws that apply to confidentiality
(adapted form Ferrara, 2002).





STATEMENT ON PLAGIARISM


Plagiarism is "passing off" the work of others as if it is our own.
Whether we directly quote a source or paraphrase it, the source must be
properly referenced.  This includes a textual reference and a listing in
the list of references at the end of a paper.  Additionally, plagiarism
includes the wholesale lifting of large quotes, as well as paraphrasing too
closely the actual words of the original author.

Plagiarism is also the copying of another student's work; after all, this
is not your work.  Even though students feel it is easy to mask this type
of plagiarism, this is not usually so.  Plagiarism is a serious offense.
In the publishing field, it is the source of many lawsuits.  In the
classroom context, it is considered a form of cheating.  If it can be
established that a paper contains plagiarism, it will be returned with no
credit given.  More serious penalties may occur depending on the degree
of plagiarism, including failure in the paper and/or failure in the
course.

We will discuss the proper methods of citing published material.  You must
use APA format for citations and references.  This format can be also found
in the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, as
well as on-line.  You are responsible for using this format in all written
work that requires citations, whether the material is quoted directly or
paraphrased (adapted from Ferrara, 2002).

RELATIONSHIP TO CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The School of Education’s goal is to prepare competent effective teacher
candidates who fulfill leadership roles primarily but not exclusively in
their schools and the education community at large. Consequently, the
School of Education places considerable emphasis on the development of
knowledge, skills and dispositions to enhance its graduates’ leadership
performance in the classroom, the school and the profession. The SOE has
adopted the following overreaching principles which link its vision and
mission to those of the college and the profession of teaching.

            ➢ A commitment to preparing teachers as professionals
            ➢ An active engagement in promoting a just world
            ➢ A belief in the interdisciplinary nature of knowledge and
              justice

STATEMENT OF PROFESSIONALISM

The School of Education (SOE) provides candidates with preparation  for  the
teaching profession.  It is important that candidates  realize  expectations
on the part of the  Education  faculty  regarding  professionalism.   It  is
critical that candidates of programs at the  SOE  understand  the  behaviors
associated with professionalism both in class and in the field.

Professionalism is demonstrated when candidates:  a) attend all  classes  on
time, b) attend all classes, c)  are  prepared  for  class  discussions,  d)
submit all assignments on due dates, and e) establish positive  interactions
with the instructor and with other classmates.

Professionalism also applies to the decorum displayed by candidates  in  the
field.  This includes, in addition to the above, dressing appropriately  for
the work setting and  demonstrating  at  all  times  professional  behavior,
including  knowledge   of   the   practices   and   laws   that   apply   to
confidentiality.

STATEMENT ON PLAGIARISM

Plagiarism is "passing off" the  work  of  others  as  if  it  is  our  own.
Whether we directly quote a source or paraphrase  it,  the  source  must  be
properly referenced.  This includes a textual reference  and  a  listing  in
the list of references at the end  of  a  paper.   Additionally,  plagiarism
includes the wholesale lifting of large quotes, as well as paraphrasing  too
closely the actual words of the original author.

Plagiarism is also the copying of another student's work;  after  all,  this
is not your work.  Even though some feel it is easy to  mask  this  type  of
plagiarism, this is not usually so.  Plagiarism is a  serious  offense.   In
the publishing field, it is the source of many lawsuits.  In  the  classroom
context, it is considered a form of cheating.   If  it  can  be  established
that a paper contains plagiarism, it will be returned with no credit  given.
 More serious penalties may occur depending on  the  degree  of  plagiarism,
including failure in the paper and/or failure in the course.

We will discuss the proper methods of citing published material.   You  must
use APA format for citations and references.  This format can be also  found
in the Publication Manual of  the  American  Psychological  Association,  as
well as on-line.  You are responsible for using this format in  all  written
work that requires citations, whether the material  is  quoted  directly  or
paraphrased.

ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS:

If you have or suspect you may have a physical, psychological, medical or
learning disability that may impact your course work, please contact The

STATEMENT OF PROFESSIONALISM
      The School of Education (SOE) provides candidates with preparation
for the teaching profession.  It is important that candidates realize
expectations on the part of the Education faculty regarding
professionalism.  It is critical that candidates of programs at the SOE
understand the behaviors associated with professionalism both in class and
in the field.
      Professionalism is demonstrated when candidates:  a) attend all
classes on time, b) attend all classes, c) are prepared for class
discussions, d) submit all assignments on due dates, and e) establish
positive interactions with the instructor and with other classmates.
      Professionalism also applies to the decorum displayed by candidates
in the field.  This includes, in addition to the above, dressing
appropriately for the work setting and demonstrating at all times
professional behavior, including knowledge of the practices and laws that
apply to confidentiality.

STATEMENT ON PLAGIARISM
      Plagiarism is "passing off" the work of others as if it is our own.
Whether we directly quote a source or paraphrase it, the source must be
properly referenced.  This includes a textual reference and a listing in
the list of references at the end of a paper.  Additionally, plagiarism
includes the wholesale lifting of large quotes, as well as paraphrasing too
closely the actual words of the original author.
      Plagiarism is also the copying of another student's work; after all,
this is not your work.  Even though some feel it is easy to mask this type
of plagiarism, this is not usually so.  Plagiarism is a serious offense.
In the publishing field, it is the source of many lawsuits.  In the
classroom context, it is considered a form of cheating.  If it can be
established that a paper contains plagiarism, it will be returned with no
credit given.  More serious penalties may occur depending on the degree of
plagiarism, including failure in the paper and/or failure in the course.
      We will discuss the proper methods of citing published material.  You
must use APA format for citations and references.  This format can be also
found in the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association,
as well as on-line.  You are responsible for using this format in all
written work that requires citations, whether the material is quoted
directly or paraphrased.

CATALOG DESCRIPTION

This supervised practicum provides the opportunity to work with an
individual or small group at both the early childhood and childhood levels.
An application of diagnostic and interventional pre-assessment in a
clinical situation will be required. Formal and informal assessments will
be used and interpreted in order to individualize instruction for
struggling readers and writers. Upon completion of the individualized
instructional plan, the candidates will be expected to assess the students’
progress and compose a summative evaluation. This course requires a field
experience of 50 hours.  This is the capstone experience of the program. (6
credits)

RELATIONSHIP TO CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

COURSE OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES

Candidates will:
    • articulate an understanding of the theoretical, historical and
      research bases of reading diagnosis, knowledge of the complexity
      involved in learning about print and becoming a fluent reader. (ILA
      1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.1, 4.2)
    • demonstrate an in-depth knowledge of the various diagnostic
      assessments (both formal and informal) and how to select, administer,
      and interpret each of these assessments to diagnosis children’s
      reading and/or writing abilities. (ILA 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.2)
    • develop an understanding of the flexibility of the diagnostic approach
      to reading that accounts for the changing nature of
      reading acquisition from beginning to independently proficient
      reading. (ILA 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.1, 4.1, 4.2)
    • model instructional strategies to foster interrelationship between
      vocabulary development and knowledge and reading comprehension
      strategies to activate students’ comprehension process. (ILA 2.1, 2.2,
      2.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3)
    • present a case study of one elementary student who has reading and/or
      writing difficulties, diagnose strengths and weaknesses, plan
      instruction based on initial diagnosis, on-going assessments that
      drive revisions of instruction, provide a summative evaluation of
      student’s progress, and plan for continued instruction. (ILA 2.1, 2.2,
      2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3)

METHOD OF INSTRUCTION
      In this course, students will participate in seminars where they will
learn through observing demonstrations of various methods before having the
opportunity to use them within the classroom.  Because of the workshop
nature of this course, it is imperative that students accept the
responsibility to be prepared and participate in each session where they
will be involved in discussion, collaboration, and evaluation of various
texts and teaching methods for adolescents.

COURSE EVALUATION & GRADING
    • Attendance & Participation                     20%


     In order to receive full credit you need to be punctual and have
     perfect attendance. All assignments need to be submitted on time.
     Class       participation is defined not as the most frequent
     responses but as the most meaningful contributions to the discussion.


    • Reader Response Journal                            20%


      You will keep a response journal while reading that should include
      your thoughts, questions, concerns, and connections to the assigned
      texts.  A detailed description and sample of a reader response journal
      will be provided in class.
    • Literature Circle Reflection      10%
      As a class we will all read Lois Lowry’s The Giver, and we will
      participate in literature circles as described by Harvey Daniels
      (2000) as a model of actively engaging with and responding to young
      adult literature. Each of you will assume a role as a reader and share
      your findings with the class on the day we engage in our literature
      circle. You will also write a reflection on this activity, exploring
      how you might use it in your own English language arts classroom. A
      detailed description of literature circles will be       provided in
      class.
    • Interview of a YA Reader           10%
      You will interview a YA reader about his/her reading habits and
      preferences. It is your responsibility to locate and set up an
      appointment with a reader. If you need help with this, please let me
      know. The interview should last about 10 – 15 minutes. You will
      transcribe the interview and submit the transcription with a
      reflection about what you learned about a YA reader in light of our
      discussions and readings in this course.


    • Lesson Plan and Demonstration                20%
      You will write a lesson plan outlining the teaching of a reading
      strategy using one of the assigned texts.  Lesson plan format will be
      discussed in class.  In addition to writing the plan, you will be
      responsible for presenting a lesson demonstration to the class.
    • Annotated Bibliography                            20%
      Your bibliography must contain a list of at least five texts that you
      can use     to accompany one of the assigned texts for the class.
      These accompanying texts can take the form of short stories, non-
      fiction articles, picture books, poems, songs, films, etc.  For each
      text you must include bibliographic information in APA format, as well
      as a rationale for choosing it and a brief description of how it can
      be used within the classroom.

A rubric will be used to assess all requirements. The specific requirements
for each activity will be defined in the rubric.

STATEMENT OF PROFESSIONALISM

The School of Education (SOE) provides candidates with preparation  for  the
teaching profession.  It is important that candidates  realize  expectations
on the part of the  Education  faculty  regarding  professionalism.   It  is
critical that candidates of programs at the  SOE  understand  the  behaviors
associated with professionalism both in class and in the field.

Professionalism is demonstrated when candidates:  a) attend all  classes  on
time, b) attend all classes, c)  are  prepared  for  class  discussions,  d)
submit all assignments on due dates, and e) establish positive  interactions
with the instructor and with other classmates.

Professionalism also applies to the decorum displayed by candidates  in  the
field.  This includes, in addition to the above, dressing appropriately  for
the work setting and  demonstrating  at  all  times  professional  behavior,
including  knowledge   of   the   practices   and   laws   that   apply   to
confidentiality.

STATEMENT ON PLAGIARISM

Plagiarism is "passing off" the  work  of  others  as  if  it  is  our  own.
Whether we directly quote a source or paraphrase  it,  the  source  must  be
properly referenced.  This includes a textual reference  and  a  listing  in
the list of references at the end  of  a  paper.   Additionally,  plagiarism
includes the wholesale lifting of large quotes, as well as paraphrasing  too
closely the actual words of the original author.

Plagiarism is also the copying of another student's work;  after  all,  this
is not your work.  Even though some feel it is easy to  mask  this  type  of
plagiarism, this is not usually so.  Plagiarism is a  serious  offense.   In
the publishing field, it is the source of many lawsuits.  In  the  classroom
context, it is considered a form of cheating.   If  it  can  be  established
that a paper contains plagiarism, it will be returned with no credit  given.
 More serious penalties may occur depending on  the  degree  of  plagiarism,
including failure in the paper and/or failure in the course.

We will discuss the proper methods of citing published material.   You  must
use APA format for citations and references.  This format can be also  found
in the Publication Manual of  the  American  Psychological  Association,  as
well as on-line.  You are responsible for using this format in  all  written
work that requires citations, whether the material  is  quoted  directly  or
paraphrased.

ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS:

If you have or suspect you may have a physical, psychological, medical or
learning disability that may impact your course work, please contact The
Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (OSSD), Phone: 516-876-
3009, Fax: 516-876-3005, TTD: 516-876-3083. The Office will help you
determine if you qualify for accommodations and help you get them. All
support services are free and all contacts with the OSSD are strictly
confidential.

METHOD OF INSTRUCTION

In this course, students will participate in seminars where they will learn
through observing demonstrations of various methods before having the
opportunity to use them within the classroom.  Because of the workshop
nature of this course, it is imperative that students accept the
responsibility to be prepared and participate in each session where they
will be involved in discussion, collaboration, and evaluation of various
teaching strategies for content area reading.

STATEMENT OF PROFESSIONALISM

The School of Education (SOE) provides candidates with preparation  for  the
teaching profession.  It is important that candidates  realize  expectations
on the part of the  Education  faculty  regarding  professionalism.   It  is
critical that candidates of programs at the  SOE  understand  the  behaviors
associated with professionalism both in class and in the field.

Professionalism is demonstrated when candidates:  a) attend all  classes  on
time, b) attend all classes, c)  are  prepared  for  class  discussions,  d)
submit all assignments on due dates, and e) establish positive  interactions
with the instructor and with other classmates.

Professionalism also applies to the decorum displayed by candidates  in  the
field.  This includes, in addition to the above, dressing appropriately  for
the work setting and  demonstrating  at  all  times  professional  behavior,
including  knowledge   of   the   practices   and   laws   that   apply   to
confidentiality.

STATEMENT ON PLAGIARISM

Plagiarism is "passing off" the  work  of  others  as  if  it  is  our  own.
Whether we directly quote a source or paraphrase  it,  the  source  must  be
properly referenced.  This includes a textual reference  and  a  listing  in
the list of references at the end  of  a  paper.   Additionally,  plagiarism
includes the wholesale lifting of large quotes, as well as paraphrasing  too
closely the actual words of the original author.

Plagiarism is also the copying of another student's work;  after  all,  this
is not your work.  Even though some feel it is easy to  mask  this  type  of
plagiarism, this is not usually so.  Plagiarism is a  serious  offense.   In
the publishing field, it is the source of many lawsuits.  In  the  classroom
context, it is considered a form of cheating.   If  it  can  be  established
that a paper contains plagiarism, it will be returned with no credit  given.
 More serious penalties may occur depending on  the  degree  of  plagiarism,
including failure in the paper and/or failure in the course.

We will discuss the proper methods of citing published material.   You  must
use APA format for citations and references.  This format can be also  found
in the Publication Manual of  the  American  Psychological  Association,  as
well as on-line.  You are responsible for using this format in  all  written
work that requires citations, whether the material  is  quoted  directly  or
paraphrased.

ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS:

If you have or suspect you may have a physical, psychological, medical or
learning disability that may impact your course work, please contact The

CATALOG DESCRIPTION
      This course provides an overview of writing instruction in adolescent
education, drawing on research to inform instructional practice. Areas of
emphasis include the writing process, creative writing, assessing writing,
the editing process, content-area writing, and organizing writing
classrooms. Students analyze how adolescent learners develop as writers,
and engage with and respond to text.

RELATIONSHIP TO CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
      The School of Education’s goal is to prepare competent and effective
candidates who fulfill leadership roles primarily but not exclusively in
their schools and the education community at large. Consequently, the
School of Education places considerable emphasis on the development of
knowledge, skills and dispositions to enhance its graduates’ leadership
performance in the classroom, the school and the profession. The SOE has
adopted the following overreaching principles which link its vision and
mission to those of the college and the profession of teaching:

    • A commitment to maintaining a professional community of teachers and
      learners
    • An active engagement in supporting practitioners as promoters of a
      just world
    • An interdisciplinary approach to knowledge and practice

STATEMENT OF PROFESSIONALISM
      The School of Education (SOE) provides candidates with preparation
for the teaching profession.  It is important that candidates realize
expectations on the part of the Education faculty regarding
professionalism.  It is critical that candidates of programs at the SOE
understand the behaviors associated with professionalism both in class and
in the field.
      Professionalism is demonstrated when candidates:  a) attend all
classes on time, b) attend all classes, c) are prepared for class
discussions, d) submit all assignments on due dates, and e) establish
positive interactions with the instructor and with other classmates.
      Professionalism also applies to the decorum displayed by candidates
in the field.  This includes, in addition to the above, dressing
appropriately for the work setting and demonstrating at all times
professional behavior, including knowledge of the practices and laws that
apply to confidentiality.

STATEMENT ON PLAGIARISM
      Plagiarism is "passing off" the work of others as if it is our own.
Whether we directly quote a source or paraphrase it, the source must be
properly referenced.  This includes a textual reference and a listing in
the list of references at the end of a paper.  Additionally, plagiarism
includes the wholesale lifting of large quotes, as well as paraphrasing too
closely the actual words of the original author.
      Plagiarism is also the copying of another student's work; after all,
this is not your work.  Even though some feel it is easy to mask this type
of plagiarism, this is not usually so.  Plagiarism is a serious offense.
In the publishing field, it is the source of many lawsuits.  In the
classroom context, it is considered a form of cheating.  If it can be
established that a paper contains plagiarism, it will be returned with no
credit given.  More serious penalties may occur depending on the degree of
plagiarism, including failure in the paper and/or failure in the course.
      We will discuss the proper methods of citing published material.  You
must use APA format for citations and references.  This format can be also
found in the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association,
as well as on-line.  You are responsible for using this format in all
written work that requires citations, whether the material is quoted
directly or paraphrased.

ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS:
      If you have or suspect you may have a physical, psychological,
medical or learning disability that may impact your course work, please

CATALOG DESCRIPTION

This supervised practicum provides the candidates with an opportunity to
work with an individual or small group at both the middle childhood and
adolescent levels. An application of diagnostic and interventional pre-
assessment in a clinical or classroom situation will be required. Formal
and informal assessments will be used and interpreted in order to
individualize instruction for struggling readers and writers. Upon
completion of the individualized instructional plan, the candidates will be
expected to assess the students’ progress and compose a summative
evaluation. This course requires a field experience of 50 hours. This is
the capstone course of this program. (6 credits)

RELATIONSHIP TO CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The School of Education’s goal is to prepare competent and effective

COURSE OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES

Candidates will:
    • articulate an understanding of the theoretical, historical and
      research bases of reading diagnosis, knowledge of the complexity
      involved in learning about print and becoming a fluent reader. (ILA
      1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.1, 4.2)
    • demonstrate an in-depth knowledge of the various diagnostic
      assessments (both formal and informal) and how to select, administer,
      and interpret each of these assessments to diagnosis adolescent
      reading and/or writing abilities. (ILA 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.2)
    • develop an understanding of the flexibility of the diagnostic approach
      to reading that accounts for the changing nature of
      reading acquisition from beginning to independently proficient
      reading. (ILA 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.1, 4.1, 4.2)
    • model instructional strategies to foster interrelationship between
      vocabulary development and knowledge and reading comprehension
      strategies to activate students’ comprehension process. (ILA 2.1, 2.2,
      2.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3)
    • present a case study of one middle or high school student who has
      reading and/or writing difficulties, diagnose strengths and
      weaknesses, plan instruction based on initial diagnosis, on-going
      assessments that drive revisions of instruction, provide a summative
      evaluation of student’s progress, and plan for continued instruction.

CATALOG DESCRIPTION

This supervised practicum provides the candidates with an opportunity to
work with an individual or small group at both the middle childhood and
adolescent levels. An application of diagnostic and interventional pre-
assessment in a clinical or classroom situation will be required. Formal
and informal assessments will be used and interpreted in order to
individualize instruction for struggling readers and writers. Upon
completion of the individualized instructional plan, the candidates will be
expected to assess the students’ progress and compose a summative
evaluation. This course requires a field experience of 50 hours. This is
the capstone course of the Adolescence Literacy Education program. Note:
Must be taken in student’s last semester.  Prerequisite: Permission of
Literacy Education Graduate Programs Coordinator.

RELATIONSHIP TO CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The School of Education’s goal is to prepare competent and effective
candidates who fulfill leadership roles primarily but not exclusively in
their schools and the education community at large. Consequently, the
School of Education places considerable emphasis on the development of
knowledge, skills and dispositions to enhance its graduates’ leadership
performance in the classroom, the school and the profession. The SOE has
adopted the following overreaching principles which link its vision and
mission to those of the college and the profession of teaching:

    • A commitment to maintaining a professional community of teachers and
      learners
    • An active engagement in supporting practitioners as promoters of a
      just world
    • An interdisciplinary approach to knowledge and practice

STATEMENT OF PROFESSIONALISM

The School of Education (SOE) provides candidates with preparation  for  the
teaching profession.  It is important that candidates  realize  expectations
on the part of the  Education  faculty  regarding  professionalism.   It  is
critical that candidates of programs at the  SOE  understand  the  behaviors
associated with professionalism both in class and in the field.

Professionalism is demonstrated when candidates:  a) attend all  classes  on
time, b) attend all classes, c)  are  prepared  for  class  discussions,  d)
submit all assignments on due dates, and e) establish positive  interactions
with the instructor and with other classmates.

Professionalism also applies to the decorum displayed by candidates  in  the
field.  This includes, in addition to the above, dressing appropriately  for
the work setting and  demonstrating  at  all  times  professional  behavior,
including  knowledge   of   the   practices   and   laws   that   apply   to
confidentiality.

STATEMENT ON PLAGIARISM

Plagiarism is "passing off" the  work  of  others  as  if  it  is  our  own.
Whether we directly quote a source or paraphrase  it,  the  source  must  be
properly referenced.  This includes a textual reference  and  a  listing  in
the list of references at the end  of  a  paper.   Additionally,  plagiarism
includes the wholesale lifting of large quotes, as well as paraphrasing  too
closely the actual words of the original author.

Plagiarism is also the copying of another student's work;  after  all,  this
is not your work.  Even though some feel it is easy to  mask  this  type  of
plagiarism, this is not usually so.  Plagiarism is a  serious  offense.   In
the publishing field, it is the source of many lawsuits.  In  the  classroom
context, it is considered a form of cheating.   If  it  can  be  established
that a paper contains plagiarism, it will be returned with no credit  given.
 More serious penalties may occur depending on  the  degree  of  plagiarism,
including failure in the paper and/or failure in the course.

We will discuss the proper methods of citing published material.   You  must
use APA format for citations and references.  This format can be also  found
in the Publication Manual of  the  American  Psychological  Association,  as
well as on-line.  You are responsible for using this format in  all  written
work that requires citations, whether the material  is  quoted  directly  or
paraphrased.

The External Evaluation Report[9] is an important component of a new
academic program proposal.  The external evaluator’s task is to examine the
program proposal and related materials, visit the campus to discuss the
proposal with faculty and review related instructional resources and
facilities, respond to the questions in this report form, and submit to the
institution an individual, signed report that speaks to the quality of, and
need for, the proposed program. The report should aim for completeness,
accuracy and objectivity.

The institution is expected to review each External Evaluation Report it
receives, prepare a single institutional response to all reports, and, as
appropriate, make changes to its program proposal and plan prior to
submitting it for SUNY review.  Following SUNY proposal approval, if an
external evaluation of the proposed program is required by the State
Education Department (SED), SUNY includes External Evaluation Reports and
the Institutional Response in the full proposal that it submits to SED for
registration.

   I. Program Evaluation


a) Assess the program’s purpose, structure, and  requirements,  as  well  as
   formal mechanisms for program administration and evaluation.  Address the
   program’s rigor, coherence, and inclusion of current material to  prepare
   candidates  for  current  requirements  (e.g.,  DASA,  new  certification
   exams).
        a. The program’s purpose is to prepare teachers with a  specialized
           degree in literacy. This purpose seems suitable, given the  need
           for teachers with this preparation (see section Ie).
        b. A total of 30-39 credits for the M.S. are commensurate in  rigor
           with other institutions granting an M.S. or MAT in Literacy.
        c. The 15-credit core courses cohere with those required  at  other
           institutions for a Literacy MAT or M.S.
        d. Program plans for early, adolescent, or both specializations are
           coherent and appropriate in scope and sequence.
        e. The specialization in early or adolescent literacy studies seems
           to cohere with the specific needs in local schools.
        f. The scope and sequence of courses offered for early, adolescent,
           and both tracks are appropriate.
        g. The syllabi reflect current content,  particularly  a  focus  on
           hands-on  experiential  learning,  reflective   practices,   and
           integration of texts for diverse learners and technology to meet
           curriculum goals.
        h. A program coordinator has been budgeted for this  program.  This
           person will be responsible for program administration  including
           advising, transfer students, approve  students  for  graduation,
           and course scheduling. It is not clear that the coordinator will
           get additional compensation or course release.  These  would  be
           helpful to support a growing program.  For  example,  a  program
           coordinator with course release would be able to spend more time
           recruiting students for the program, which  would  probably  pay
           for itself in new student enrollment tuition.
        i. See section Ic for comments on program evaluation.

b) Comment on the special focus of this program, if any, as  it  relates  to
   the discipline.
        a. The ability to specialize in early  childhood,  adolescence,  or
           both is a thoughtful design, since many teachers tend  to  focus
           in one area or the other. Also,  this  specialization  seems  to
           provide an opportunity for deeper learning in  one  or  both  of
           these areas than might be provided by a general “Literacy”  M.S.
           or MAT. Further, this seems to align with the goals of NYSED.
        b. The focus on preparing literacy leaders,  literacy  specialists,
           literacy  coaches  to  provide  differentiated  instruction   in
           listening, speaking, reading, and writing for culturally diverse
           learners reflects the expectations in our field.
        c. There is a great need for a focus on social justice in programs,
           particularly given the rising disparities and diversities in the
           U.S. I think the focus on social justice could  potentially  set
           this  program  apart  from  other  programs.   The   plans   for
           implementing a social justice focus  for  this  program  include
           preparing teachers for engaging in culturally relevant pedagogy,
           integrating popular culture into instruction, using  texts  that
           address these issues, and engagement with community partners  to
           achieve social justice in local schools.
        d.  I  would  suggest  further  highlighting  your  integration  of
           technologies across curriculum teaching. Based on  your  syllabi
           you are doing this, and it is becoming increasingly important in
           the field. You might just draw more attention to  this  in  your
           proposal.
        e. The courses in children and adolescent literature seem important
           for preparing  teachers  specializing  in  literacy,  given  the
           importance of using appropriate texts for high quality  literacy
           instruction. There exists a lot  of  potential  for  integrating
           social justice field assignments into these courses.

c) Comment on the plans and expectations for self-assessment and  continuous
   improvement.
        a. The program plans for  being  evaluated  by  CAEP  and  IRA  are
           rigorous.
        b. Both of those evaluation processes require  collection  of  data
           and its analysis, which will inform program improvements.

d) Discuss the relationship of this program to other programs of the
   institution and collaboration with other institutions, and assess
   available support from related programs.
        a. Given its specialized nature, there is little need for
           collaboration with other programs within the institution.
        b. Other SUNY programs, most specifically SUNY Albany, were used as
           models for the development of this program.

e) What is the evidence of need and demand for the program locally,  in  the
   State, and in the field at large?  What is  the  extent  of  occupational
   demand for graduates?  What is the evidence that demand will continue?
        a. Based on a survey of local school districts, it seems that  this
           program will help fulfill a need in local schools  for  teachers
           who specialize in early or adolescent literacy.
        b. There is a reported shortage of teachers with  advanced  degrees
           in Literacy in the NYC Public Schools.
        c. This will be the only  MAT  in  Literacy  offered  at  a  public
           institution in Long Island. Thus, this program is  important  to
           provide access to this advanced degree  for  more  students  for
           whom the cost of a private degree,  or  the  travel  to  another
           borough, is prohibitive.
        d. Based on the evidence presented,  it  sounds  to  me  like  this
           program could improve Old  Westbury’s  enrollment,  increasingly
           across time.

II. Faculty

a) Evaluate the faculty,  individually  and  collectively,  with  regard  to
   training, experience, research and publication, professional service, and
   recognition in the field in relation to courses to be taught.
        a. Faculty who will teach the program courses  will  all  have  NYS
           teaching certifications and a terminal  degree.  Currently,  the
           majority of these faculty credentials are in literacy, which  is
           ideal.
        b. Nicole Siebenhas has an Ed.D. in English with  a  specialization
           in writing, which aligns well with her  assignment  to  teaching
           writing courses in the program.

b) Assess the faculty in terms of number and plans for future staffing.
        a. Amy Hsu, Ed.D – full time
        b. Stephanie Schneider, Ph.D. – full time
        c. Nicole Sieben, Ed.D – full time
        d. One new tenure-track position – full time
        e. Jennifer Dardzinski, Ph.D – part time
        f. The faculty who are listed in the program application (above)
           have appropriate backgrounds (terminal degrees and NYS teaching
           certifications).
        g. Four full-time (includes one new hire), one part-time, and an
           adjunct faculty seem sufficient to start the program, given the
           small program size. Proposed hiring of new faculty after the
           program grows will be important.

c) Evaluate faculty responsibilities for the proposed program, taking into
   account their other institutional and programmatic commitments.
        a. Three full-time faculty teaching in the program 67% time, and
           one part-time faculty, along with funding for an adjunct seem
           sufficient given the small program size.

d) Evaluate faculty activity in generating funds for research, training,
   facilities, equipment, etc.
        a. All three full-time faculty members serving this program have
           already received grants (6, 1, and 8 each respectively).

e) Evaluate credentials and involvement of adjunct faculty, including  field
   supervisors, and support personnel.
        a. The adjunct faculty member has  a  Ph.D.  in  literacy  and  NYS
           certification.
        b. Field supervisors are  not  relevant  to  this  program  because
           program faculty will be doing supervision.
        c. Dr. Espinoza (Director of Graduate Studies) plans to support the
           literacy program coordinator and  understands  the  benefits  of
           providing course release or compensation for the person in  this
           position.

f) Discuss any critical gaps related to faculty and stated campus plans  for
   addressing identified gaps.
        a. No gaps were identified.




III. Students

a) Comment on the student population the program seeks to serve, and assess
   plans and projections for student recruitment and enrollment.
        a. Based on a survey of current undergraduate  students,  it  seems
           that there is interest in  this  program  amongst  undergraduate
           students.
        b. I am not sure how the projections for doubling  enrollment  were
           made, but it seems reasonable to increase  the  program  at  the
           suggested rate.
        c. When there are less than 30 graduate students  in  the  program,
           there will a small number of students in each of the specialized
           courses (e.g., in 7200, those 15-30 students will be parsed into
           3 tracks—early, adolescent, both; that is only 5-10 students per
           class); but these low  numbers  are  deemed  acceptable  at  the
           graduate level at this institution.
        d. The plan to recruit from  local  school  districts  to  increase
           numbers seems reasonable. A survey  of  interest  amongst  these
           teachers also showed significant interest in the program.
        e.  After  meeting  the  program  faculty,  I   can   imagine   how
           undergraduate students will want to  return  to  their  master’s
           level   program.   These   faculty   members   are    energetic,
           enthusiastic, and knowledgeable about their field. They will  be
           the program’s best assets.

b) Will recruitment efforts and admissions criteria result in a sufficient
   pool of highly qualified applicants and enrollees?
        a.  The  entrance  requirements  seem  reasonable  to  generate  an
           appropriate pool of students for this program, and  commensurate
           with those of other programs.


c)    Comment on recruitment plans for candidates from underrepresented
   groups.
        a. The program plan to recruit from local school districts and
           offer one scholarship for a teacher from an underrepresented
           group addresses this issue.

d) Does the program give adequate attention to the needs of part-time,
   minority, and disadvantaged students?
        a. Two to four classes per semester is the norm for this college at
           the graduate level, and ability to complete the program  in  2.5
           years is important given the requirement  that  teachers  get  a
           master’s level degree within five years of beginning teaching.


e) Assess the system for monitoring students’ progress and performance and
   for advising students regarding academic and career matters.
        a. Advising services are provided throughout the program, and
           students are required to meet regularly with their advisor for
           mentoring and advice.
        b. The advisor  is responsible for monitoring students’ progress
           and performance, which seems reasonable given the small program
           size.

IV. Resources

a) Comment on the adequacy  of  physical  resources  and  facilities,  e.g.,
   library, computer, and laboratory facilities.
        a. Resources to support the program are more than adequate.
        b. First, there are newly renovated classrooms, a digital commons,
           and a writing center.
        c. Second, many resources are housed in a three-floor renovated
           library, such as laptops, iPads, video cameras, and access to
           online databases such as ERIC, Psy Info, etc.
        d. Third, a Curriculum Materials Center provides a special space
           for teacher resources to support teachers’ access and use of
           relevant high quality texts and other materials. Teaching
           resources in the center include big books, performance related
           materials, curricula-based kits, and picture books that will
           support the diversity focus highlighted across the Literacy
           Program coursework. Introductory workshops about how to use the
           curriculum resource lab, and collaborative classes with
           professors are available too.
        e. The Library Director and Education Librarian reported that
           current library funds are adequate to meet the needs of the
           proposed literacy MS program, but noted that maintaining the
           physical space of the Curriculum Materials Center is vital.


b) Comment on the adequacy of resources for locating  field  experience  and
   student  teaching/practicum  sites  and  for  supporting  students  while
   completing these experiences.
        a.  It  sounds  like  Old  Westbury  has  excellent  resources  for
           identifying field placement and practicum sites.  They  have  in
           place a Director of Field Experience and Clinical Services,  and
           have connections with 36 districts on Long Island,  as  well  as
           all boroughs of New York City.

c) Comment on the partnerships in place and  their  ability  to  provide  an
   adequate   number   of   sites   for   field   placements   and   student
   teaching/practicum in relation to the number of students in the  program.


        a. The resources cited above seem more than adequate for placing 15-
           30 students.

d)  Based   on   discussions   with   faculty   and   administrators   about
   administrative  support  for  the  program,  what  is   the   degree   of
   institutional commitment  to  the  program  as  demonstrated  by  a)  the
   operating budget, b) faculty salaries, c) the  number  of  faculty  lines
   relative to student numbers and d) workload?
        a. Operating budget, faculty salaries, number of faculty lines, and
           workload seem adequate given the institutional  course-load  and
           projected numbers of students.

IV. Summary Comments and Additional Observations

a) Summarize the major strengths and weaknesses of the program as proposed
   with particular attention to feasibility of implementation and
   appropriateness of objectives for the degree offered, including the need
   for preparation in the specific certificate title(s).
        a. A major strength of this program is its integration of hands-on
           experiential learning, reflective practices, texts for diverse
           learners, and technology to meet curriculum goals across
           courses. These cohere with notions of best practices for teacher
           preparation in our field.
        b. Another strength is that this program seems to meet a need for
           access to advanced training in Literacy teaching. No other
           public institutions on Long Island are meeting this need, and
           local schools report a shortage and need for teachers with this
           specialization.
        c. A third, and critical, strength that cannot be highlighted
           enough is the energy and enthusiasm of the professors who are
           invested in developing and implementing this program.
        d. One potential need for the program may be to increase numbers of
           students over time to make the program maintainable. However,
           starting the program small and growing it seems wise, and there
           also seems to be a plan in place for increasing numbers over
           time to grow the program by reaching teachers in local schools
           who have expressed a need for teachers with Literacy
           specialization, particularly through the role of the program
           coordinator.

b) If applicable, particularly for graduate programs, comment on the ways
   that this program will make a unique contribution to the field, and its
   likelihood of achieving State, regional, and/or national prominence.
        a. The program focus on social justice could make a unique
           contribution to the field, both through preparation of teachers
           who can address social justice issues through literacy
           instruction, and also by faculty engaging in research related to
           how to best prepare teachers for this role.


c) Include any further observations important to the evaluation of this
   program proposal and provide any recommendations for the proposed
   program.
        a. I recommend this program be approved.













                                 Appendix D:
                 Institutional Response to External Reviews

Institutional Response

Both external reviewers found the proposed programs in Literacy Education
to be very strong and consistent with New York State requirements for
professional literacy certification.  In addition, they found the programs
fulfill the increased need for teachers who hold certification in literacy.

Dr. Christ commended the program for integrating technologies across
curriculum teaching as evidence by the course syllabi.  She suggested that
we highlight this a bit more in the proposal, so we have revised the
student learning outcomes of the programs to better highlight our focus on
digital literacies and integration of technology.

While she was concerned about small numbers of students in each class at
the onset of these programs, we do not share the same concerns.  Students
will be divided between two different tracks, with some overlap of those
who choose to cover the entire certification range of B-12.  Based on our
projections, classes will run with no fewer than 10 students, and with many
of the core pedagogy classes having an anticipated enrollment of 25
students when the programs begin.

Both Dr. Christ and Dr. Rhodes commented on the need for the coordinator of
these new programs to receive a reduced teaching load or additional
compensation in order to participate in site visits, recruit students, and
organize and implement the new programs.  We encourage the administration
at Old Westbury to be supportive of the appointed program coordinator so
that this program can be successful.

Dr. Rhodes also suggested that there is a strong need for additional
faculty with licensure in the area of literacy to be hired.   Currently,
one full-time and one part-time faculty hold NYS certification in Reading.
In addition, one other full-time faculty holds a PhD in Literacy and is
eligible to hold NYS certification as a Reading Specialist.  The two
literacy faculty members to be hired will both hold or be eligible to hold
NYS certification as a Reading Specialist as indicated in the
advertisements for faculty to be hired attached to the proposal.

In order to meet the needs of the program, Dr. Rhodes recommended that
writing intensive assignments should be included within the courses of the
program.  As the profession of a Literacy Specialist is quite writing
intensive, we agree and as such have included writing intensive assignments
in our course syllabi to reflect this including response papers,
professional reports, research papers, and detailed analyses.

Dr. Rhodes also advised program faculty to become familiar with the
International Literacy Associations forthcoming proposed new standards.
Currently ILA uses standards from 2010 and the proposed programs are based
on these.  As the new standards are developed and approved, we will be sure
to continue to align our course content and assignments with the content
and rigor that is expected from ILA.

In her report, Dr. Rhodes reminds us to work through the logistics of our
50-hour field components.  We have a foundation in place to conduct this
practicum requirement, and will work to be sure all logistics are covered
as soon as the proposed program is accepted and we have an official program
start date.  This will give us two full years to be sure all components are
in place for a successful field experience for our graduate students and
the K-12 students with whom we will work.

Finally, Dr. Rhodes suggested that online or hybrid courses should be
offered to further attract students to the proposed programs.  This is a
suggestion we are willing to explore once the proposed program begins.  All
of the faculty involved in this program have some experience teaching
hybrid classes and are interested in further training to learn more about
teaching effective online classes specific to a literacy graduate program.
