RESOLUTION TO ENHANCE AND MODERNIZE THE RESEARCH ENTERPRISE

AT

THE COLLEGE AT OLD WESTBURY

 

BACKGROUND:



The research endeavor benefits faculty scholarship, active student curricular and extracurricular engagement in applied learning opportunities, and the larger community in multiple ways.  The SUNY Old Westbury administration, the SUNY Research Foundation (SUNY-RF) the Office of Research Sponsored Programs (ORSP), the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and the Faculty Development Grant (FDG) committees are currently the responsible parties dedicated to carrying out the operations necessary for supporting and achieving excellence in research activities at the College. 



There are, however, a number of specific areas where the infrastructural support for research activities and innovation at Old Westbury is constrained, does not facilitate the achievement of excellence in the research endeavor, and also does not meet current structures and standards at comparable SUNY and non-SUNY institutions. 



These can be broadly classified into three areas: 

I - Extramural and intramural research grant-related issues and constraints 

II - Approval process and tracking of research proposals, expenditures, administrative approvals, and Software issues and constraints, and 

III - Support for research infrastructure support, oversight, maintenance, and modernization.

 

This Resolution outlines the aforementioned issues and offers suggestions to ameliorate these problems in an effort to support the enhancement and modernization of the research endeavor on campus.

 

RATIONALE:



The Faculty, Staff, and Students are the main constituents that serve to raise the profile of the College as they are the main campus producers of research that benefit our local communities, professional fields, and communities abroad as consumers of our campus research activities, innovations, products, new technology inventions, patents, etc.



The work that the College administration, the ORSP (Office of Research Sponsored Programs), the SUNY-RF (SUNY- Research Foundation), the IRB (the Institutional Review Board), and the IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee), and the FDG (Faculty Development Grant) Committees have done for the College during these challenging times is much appreciated.  However, many of the problems and constraints existed prior to the time of the pandemic, and many of those issues were exacerbated by it.  

The specific issues are outlined below serve as the rationale for the WHEAREAS clauses that follow: 

EXTRAMURAL AND INTRAMURAL RESEARCH GRANT-RELATED ISSUES/CONSTRAINTS:



There is no clear or transparent centralized process that informs Faculty, Staff, and Students how indirect costs acquired from extramural funding are used, reallocated, and/or charged back to balance the financial business of the College.



There is no clear or transparent process for the allocation of a set percentage of indirect costs acquired from extramural funding to: 

be used for stimulating intramural grants (e.g., FDG) at the College 

be set aside for equipment repairs and service contracts; and 

develop a research supply emergency fund.



There is no clear or transparent process for annual funding allocations (from sources other than from extramural funding) to be used for stimulating FDG grants at the College; 



The annual schedule of the solicitation for the FDG application cycle is variable; sometimes occurs both Fall and Spring semesters but sometimes only once in the academic year; and often occurs too late within a given semester 



There are often significant delays in the FDG award notification process which impedes the timely implementation and completion of FDG funded research.



There are often significant delays in the review of FDG or other funded projects, which again impedes the timely implementation and completion of funded research



Once an FDG is awarded, the utilization of funds is hindered at multiple points such as:

substantial delays in obtaining funds from administration to conduct research activities in a timely manner, and

unclear processes to obtain and confirm quotes and/or purchases, and

unclear administrative approvals to order and purchase research supplies and equipment.

Inability to identify approval agents or track approval processes 

 

These inconsistencies in the intermural funding process have consistently hampered the ability to conduct initial research in a timely manner and thereby reduced the ability to obtain pilot data to augment the efforts for additional extramural funding; and as well set back effective participation in applied learning activities.



 APPROVAL PROCESS AND TRACKING OF RESEARCH PROPOSALS, EXPENDITURES, AND ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVALS AND SOFTWARE



There is no clear or transparent system to track the administrative approval process of Local Approval Forms and Grant Submissions; and

There is no clear or transparent system to track purchase orders for research supplies/consumables, equipment, and software; and

There is no clear or transparent system to track the approval process of the IRB and the IACUC research proposals; and

There is no clear, transparent, or modern software/technology system in place to streamline the IRB proposal review process so as to facilitate:

 requests for expedited reviews,

timely reviews that allow research to be approved and conducted within a single semester.  (This time-factor is essential for student-led research)

efficient response to queries and approvals to conduct meaningful research on campus; and

While there is a clear and transparent system in place for the IACUC to streamline the review of submitted research proposals, IACUC lacks a modern software/technology system for reviewing research proposals

 

The aforementioned issues prevent Faculty, Staff, and Students from actively engaging in research during the Fall and Spring semesters, which, as detailed above, directly reduces the research output from the campus and further hinders the Faculty, Staff, and Students’ ability to obtain critical pilot data to apply for both intramural and extramural funding opportunities; and the prioritization of  Student curricular and extracurricular engagement in applied learning and research activities given their unique and often restricted timelines; and

 

 SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT, OVERSIGHT, MAINTENANCE, AND MODERNIZATION:



The computer, wet, and dry laboratory spaces are in need of modernization and currently are not effectively or strategically managed

Currently the IRB and the IACUC lack an oversight committee to assess, evaluate and facilitate resolution of issues which arise in those committees.
