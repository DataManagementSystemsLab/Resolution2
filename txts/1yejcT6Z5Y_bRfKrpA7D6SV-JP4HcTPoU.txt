Jennie,
We met with Hanover today over Teams and traded some emails last week when I shared
your complete list of questions with Hanover. In summary, we will add some of the questions
you collected from faculty and delete at least 2 of the demographic questions they asked that
are not as relevant for our population.
Hanover let us know that limiting a survey to approx. 40 questions is ideal for a good
response rate. Currently the redacted survey has about 39 questions. We will eliminate the
demographic questions about what level of education the student entered with and what their
high school GPA was and insert two different questions that gets at their age range and their
employment status (full-time and part-time or none).
The goal of the survey is primarily to learn about why many applicants did not choose to
enroll at OW and why some do and how Enrollment Services can use this information to
yield more of our applicants and better target new prospects based on what we learn. This
first survey will be an undergraduate survey.
The survey will ask and we will obtain results which will segment what is important to first
year students when choosing a college vs what is important to transfers when choosing a
college.
Since 89% of our students commute and less than 11% live in campus, we probably cannot add
that segmentation to this initial survey.

I am not sure that adding detail about the Excelsior scholarship and TAP and Pell grants is
necessary, but we can tweak the language of the question to make sure that it is understood
that financial aid mean scholarships too.
The plan is to launch the Hanover to the 3,800 names and emails of students we accepted
for Fall 2021, most of which did not choose SUNY OW. See your questions below. I added
comments/questions to email in yellow. We may not be able to launch until early Jan. now.

Subject: enrollment project feedback

Hi Monica, Lisandra, and Mike,
Below is copied feedback from faculty and staff. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------With the financial aid package question, does that include scholarships (like Excelsior, etc.)?
This may need to be explicitly stated. (Could the word scholarships be added into the mix of
fin aid questions so the reader knows that fin aid includes all aid? YES)
Can we add a question on if the student is a commuter or resident at OW - may need to
save this for a future survey
Can we add questions to the demographic section on age and employment status? Yes.
We think that course availability and time to degree could be reasons students choose OW
or choose to not attend OW and would like to see those options added to relevant questions.
(Transfer credit policy is one of the multiple choices. Enrollment won't be able to act on
availability answer in a timely fashion for this recruitment cycle.)
Can we add something to those same questions on vaccine hesitancy? (Hanover, we
mandated that all on campus students must be vaccinated and we did it late in the game
August 2021. Hanover will tweak existing COVID question to address this,)
There is concern that doing this survey at this moment will cause us to have to redo it once
we are through the pandemic and people are no longer effected by it. Having just a handful
of questions to address COVID seems like not enough to make the rest of the survey hold up
in the post-COVID world. A student may not realize that COVID effected their decisions or
finances. (One survey is never going to satisfy all needs and questions.)
Given that we are a state operated institution, and do not have financial aid to offer outside of
TAP and PELL grants, the financial aid packaging questions don't feel appropriate/genuine.
(52% of our students receive full fin aid and 67% receive some form of fin aid. Given how low
of tuition is, any low-income kid who applies for fin aid may come here for no tuition. The
cost of the residence hall is the "reach." We serve 89% commuters!)
Questions on cost of attendance, don't line up with OW cost of attendance except for
resident students. Our Commuter students pay for tuition & fees $8,379 per
year without TAP & PELL so having a baseline of less than $10,000 seems a little off unless
we add the question on resident versus commuter. However, even with that question if this
question is specific to OW, I don't see HOW a student could pay $35000 a year to attend OW
when tuition, fees, and Room & Board top out at $20,799 for an instate student. Do we really
think students are paying $10,000 in books and gas? (I did not see this in your survey.)

Perhaps we should also ask the students about their status of transfer versus first time to
college as well as a follow up for first time to college on whether or not they entered OW with
pre-college credits (AP, CLEP, etc). (50% of our students are first year in college and 50%
are transfers)
How does Hanover's student survey compare with OW student surveys? What are the
differences? (I am not aware of student surveys we have done in house. I heard there is a
SUNY climate survey.)
Will Hanover's data be compared to data already obtained by Institutional Advancement?
YES.
And if so, when will faculty have access to the results? (We will share the results of the
survey with Faculty senate and Hanover will be available for a Q&A for any additional
questions faculty have after results are released. )
Faculty have historically had to either request the data several times and/or have no
knowledge beforehand that the survey was being conducted.
Exactly who will have access to this data, and when, with what granularity and timeline
(Jennie also asked this question to Lisandra this morning, she said she would follow up
soon.) High level OW results like you saw in redacted report will be shared widely.
Will the faculty have an opportunity to respond to Hanover's data? Yes.
