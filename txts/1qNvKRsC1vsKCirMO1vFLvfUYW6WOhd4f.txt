During the COVID-19 crisis, the campus waived some of its distance learning policies, such as limits on the number of
distance courses offered, training expectations, and expectations for faculty to be present on campus. (See “Distance
Learning Policies,” https://www.oldwestbury.edu/policies/distance-learning-policies). These policies will resume once faceto-face instruction is again possible.
* As described in the 2018-2020 College Catalog, page 46, the course expectations for a 4-credit, 15 week course carries the following expectations for
student workload: a traditional (in-class or synchronous) course has 180 direct contact minutes, plus 420 outside-of class minutes; a hybrid (in-class or
synchronous) has 90 direct contact minutes per week, plus 510 outside-of-class minutes; a blended (in-class or synchronous) course has 1-179 direct
contact minutes per week, plus 599-421 outside-of-class minutes (for a total of 600 minutes), as articulated in the syllabus; an online (asynchronous)
course carries an expectation of 0 direct contact minutes and 600 outside-of-class minutes per week. These weekly expectations shall be pro-rated for
