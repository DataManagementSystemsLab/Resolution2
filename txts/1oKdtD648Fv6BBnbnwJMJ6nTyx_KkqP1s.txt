In the spring 2021 semester the Committee held three online meetings (2/2, 2/23, 3/25), and continue
to carry out its work online. Four members of the Committee (C. DeVirgilio, B. Hillery, C, Hope, J.

Registered OER Courses – Spring 2021
The Committee reviews OER course syllabi and course materials to determine whether they meet
SUNY’s requirements to be designated as an OER course and identified with the OER attribute in the
course registration system. A course section is designated as OER if more than 50% of the assigned
course materials is comprised of open educational resources. This designation is on a semester-by1|Page

Registered OER Courses – Summer & Fall 2021
On March 8, 2021, the Committee sent an email to all faculty asking for their draft summer and fall 2021
syllabi for review if they wanted to have the courses identified as OER in the registration system. As of
this writing, there are 3 summer and 25 fall courses registered. Two of all those courses (1 summer, 1
fall) are newly developed OER course sections. Twenty-six are repeated courses that were taught in
prior semesters.
