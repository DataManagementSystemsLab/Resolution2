Supplement to Point of Information

Prepared by Parliamentarian (Maureen Dolan) 

Faculty Senate Meeting of March 16, 2018





Some Procedural Basics re. Debate and Action on Resolution dealing with Time-Sensitive Matter



Resolutions are usually introduced to the Senate under New Business, then acted upon in a subsequent meeting. For resolutions dealing with time-sensitive matter(s), the Chair has discretion to allow debate and action in a single session, consistent with faculty governance precedence and University Faculty Senate standards and practices. 



After a resolution has been read into the record, and assuming it has been seconded, the floor is open to debate. The Chair is responsible for conducting debate, during which Senators argue “For or Against” a resolution. The Chair may rule tangential commentary “out of order”.

The Chair has discretion in procedural matters of debate, including but not limited to:



Recognizing sequence of Senators to speak (e.g., in order of hands raised)     

Recognizing non-Senators to speak, assuming that a Senator yields time

Possibly limiting the allotted time per speaker, especially when many in queue  

Asking for informal “Sense of the Senate” to determine if unanimous consent is feasible 



Note: Speakers raising “Point of Information” or “Point of Order” may have the floor out of sequence.

Some Options available to Senate in consideration of resolution on time-sensitive matter:



Vote on approval of resolution (Yes, No, Abstain) – by voice, hand or paper ballot

Vote to continue debate at a Special Meeting of the Senate (prior to 3/29 deadline for comments)

Vote to refer to Executive Committee (for action related to 3/29 deadline for comments)

Vote to postpone Senate action on resolution to a subsequent Senate meeting (after the 3/29 deadline for comments)



Note: Any amendments, ancillary or substitute resolutions are normally acted upon prior to main resolution.
