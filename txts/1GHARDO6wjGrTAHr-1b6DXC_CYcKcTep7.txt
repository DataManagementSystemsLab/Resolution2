Resolution on Academic Clemency Policy



Academic Practices and Policy Committee

November 12, 2019



WHEREAS, SUNY Old Westbury currently has no clemency policy to guide readmission for students who discontinue their studies due to low GPA, and 



WHEREAS, many peer institutions, including SUNY Stony Brook, Nassau Community College, CUNY Queens College, CUNY John Jay College and others, have such policies, and



WHEREAS, in the context of declining college enrollment statewide, lack of such policy hinders our ability to recruit and retain students vis-à-vis our peers, therefore



BE IT RESOLVED that the College adopt the following Academic Clemency Policy which aligns closely—in terms of period of student absence, class standing candidacy and readmission procedures—with those of ten SUNY and CUNY peers (Stony Brook, Nassau CC, Buffalo State, Potsdam, Brockport, Queens College LaGuardia CC, Lehman, Baruch and John Jay) as well as that of neighboring Adelphi University.







Academic Clemency Policy



Old Westbury students who have stopped-out and been absent for 5 consecutive calendar years may apply for academic clemency if their GPA at readmission is below 2.0.  Students should follow the readmission process.



Academic clemency will remove enough courses’ grades, up to a maximum of 32 credits, from the student’s GPA to bring it to 2.0, or as close thereto as the 32 credit limit allows.  The courses and corresponding grades will remain on the student’s transcript, and due to Federal and State regulations will still be included in determinations of financial aid eligibility, but the adjusted GPA will be used to determine academic standing and eligibility to graduate.



In order to have academic clemency applied, students must complete a petition with their Academic Advisor, which then must be approved by their School’s Dean or Director.  Clemency will only be awarded after the student completes 12 credits with a 2.0 or higher after readmission.  For graduation, the student must complete all other SUNY, college and major requirements.  The clemency policy can only be applied once to a student’s record, and it cannot be applied to a previously earned degree.
