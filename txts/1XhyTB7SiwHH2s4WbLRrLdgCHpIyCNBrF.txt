      objectives and strategies for each objective were distributed, along
      with the status for each strategy. Each is aligned with components
      from the SUNY Excels matrix.

VI. Resolution on Marketing (Kathleen Greenberg)

    • Faculty members expressed concern about the representation of SUNY OW,
      diversity, our mission, and the lack of follow-through based on the

VIII. Curriculum and Academic Planning (CAP) (Frank Sanacory)

    • CAP reviewed four proposals:
         o Program Announcement for a BS in Environmental Science and
           Systems
         o Program Announcement for a BA in Environmental Studies and
           Sustainability
         o Minor in Entertainment and Sports Management
               ▪ housed in school of professional studies, and will be
                 taught primarily by adjuncts.
               ▪ Concerns included: not being housed in a department,
                 being separate from the expertise of the faculty, no full
                 time faculty teaching in the program,
               ▪ Response: the history of OW being taught without
                 departments; other program announcements are being housed
                 in schools rather than departments; degree bearing programs
                 require 1 full time faculty member to teach, but this is
                 only a minor.
         o Minor in Italian Cultural Studies
    •  CAP voted unanimously in favor of all proposals.

    • A Senator expressed concern of the lack of communication with faculty
      teaching in the area of environmental studies and sustainability, as
      she teaches in the area and was not approached.

      systems” passed with 21 in favor
