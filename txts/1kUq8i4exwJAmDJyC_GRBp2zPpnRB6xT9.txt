The College will be officially closed on these holidays.

**

Colleges will remain open on these legal holidays (not Saturday). The State has designated
Lincoln’s Birthday and Election Day to be observed as floating holidays in 2021 by
employees in the Management Confidential, Administrative Services, Operational Services,
Institutional Services and Professional, Scientific and Technical Services bargaining units.
The College President has designated Lincoln’s Birthday and Election Day to be observed
as floating holidays by UUP. Election Day, for Managerial Confidential staff and UUP
members, will be observed on the day after Thanksgiving. Lincoln’s Birthday for
Managerial Confidential employees and UUP members may be celebrated at the discretion
of the employee with advance supervisory approval and consistent with the operating needs
of the College. Members of the CSEA unit and the PS&T unit may, under the terms of the
Agreements, select the days on which they wish to celebrate both floating holidays (with
prior approval of their supervisors and consistent with operating needs of the College.)

***

Please note that there are several State Holidays which fall during the academic year when
classes are in session. In these instances, offices are minimally staffed, based on the
supervisor’s discretion and consistent with the operating needs of the College. Please refer
to the Presidential Memo: Maintenance of Essential Services During Certain State
Holidays, which was issued on November 2, 1987.

****

Official Holidays that fall on a Sunday will be observed by employees on the following
Monday.

*+

If any of the holidays enumerated in Section 21.1 of the Attendance Rules or in the subject
contract articles fall on a Saturday, another day will be designated as a holiday in lieu
thereof or employees will be allowed equivalent compensatory time off.
Floating Holidays must be used within one year of the date of traditional observance.
If you have any questions, please feel free to call the Office of Human Resources at
extension 3179 or 3171.
