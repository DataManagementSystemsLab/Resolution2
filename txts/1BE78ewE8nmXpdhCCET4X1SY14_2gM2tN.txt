Hi Judy. I got this from Mona.

Do you want to check and see if their corrections are accurate. If not, I'll

call them; if so, can we enter it into the corrections of the minutes?

Naomi:

Upon reviewing the above minutes, we came across some incorrect information which we would like to
clarify and have corrected if possible:
Chair's Report:

The BPC has not been reconfigured into 4 work groups. The work groups are not replacing the BPC,
rather they exist in support of it.
Also ... in this item, the last work group is called Data Collection & Analysis.

In the Chair's Report in the Questions/Comments section, regarding the question about mandates for the
BPC subcommittees, the paragraph should reflect the fact that the purpose of the Work Groups is to make
recommendations to the BPC, the purpose of which, in turn, is to make recommendations to the
President.
Thanks very much.
