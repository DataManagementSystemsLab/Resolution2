Resolution on Academic Village Rehabilitation

Whereas,

Whereas,

the Academic Village is the most widely used classroom building on the

campus;
a report issued by the NYSUT Health and Safety Office dated

December 20, 2000 cited numerous health and safety issues in Academic

Village many of which still have not been addressed;
Whereas,
the Middle States team noted the generally poor quality of facilities in 2001
and recommended that facilities be brought up to acceptable standards (see
Middle States Follow-Up Report 4/1/03, 3-1 for Middle States
recommendation and College response);
Whereas, — subsequent College documents including the 2004-2009 Campus Capital
Plan, the Progress Letter to Middle States 3/31/04, and Mission Review II

have continued to refer to serious problems with campus facilities;
Whereas,
these physical conditions adversely affect teaching, learning, recruitment,
and retention;
Whereas, _ the improvement of image including facilities is one of the three goals for
the College agreed upon by the administration and the Chancellor’s office
(see for example, Faculty Senate Minutes, 10/29/04, p.5; 12/1/04 revised
Mission Review I, p. 30);

Whereas,

the Administration has given repeated assurances that it is committed to the

rehabilitation of Academic Village but has yet to offer a comprehensive plan;
Be it resolved that, by the end of February 2005, Dr. Butts submit to the Faculty Senate a
detailed and comprehensive plan containing the process, the stages and a corresponding
timetable for the rehabilitation of Academic Village.
