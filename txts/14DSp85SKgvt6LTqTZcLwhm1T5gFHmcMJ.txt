Resolution on Establishing Limits to the Use of Credit/No Credit Toward Degree Completion
Whereas there is currently no specified limit on the number of Credit/No Credit (CR/NC)
courses that can be used toward students’ degree at SUNY College at Old Westbury (OW); and
Whereas some other SUNY-affiliated colleges have set limits to the number of credits that can
be fulfilled by a CR/NC or P/F option;1 and
Whereas an increasing number of students have become aware of the option of selecting the
CR/NC option since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic; and
Whereas it is recognized by faculty that the student population at OW disproportionately faces
socio-structural obstacles (financial, familial, etc.) to academic success, especially since the start
of the pandemic; and
Whereas providing some limited degree of academic flexibility to students to help them
overcome barriers to completing their degrees is therefore consistent with the social justice
mission of the college; and
Whereas it is also imperative that OW maintains high academic standards in order to facilitate
the intellectual and professional growth of its students; and
Whereas the option of CR/NC may lead some students to put less than full effort into their work
for those courses for which this option is selected (since, for example, receiving a D will provide
credit for the course without negatively impacting the students’ GPA, and may therefore lead
some students to only do the bare minimum to pass courses for which CR/NC option is
selected); and
Whereas excessive use of the CR/NC option may therefore act as an overall impediment to
students’ academic development;
Be it resolved, that SUNY College at Old Westbury limit the number of credits that can count
towards a student’s degree from courses for which the CR/NC option is selected to 16; that no
more than 8 credits earned from CR/NC courses can count towards degree completion per one
academic year; and no more than 4 credits earned from CR/NC course can count towards
degree completion per semester; and
Be it also resolved that Schools and Departments have flexibility to establish additional
restrictions on the selection of the CR/NC option for students in their respective programs; and

Be it also resolved that students be strongly encouraged (but not mandated) to consult with an
adviser from their School or Department before selecting CR/NC for any course.
