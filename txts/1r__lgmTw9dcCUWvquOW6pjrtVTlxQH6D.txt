Hear from the students!
"I had a great experience in the Faculty-Sophomore Mentor Program. Dr. Toolis was an
excellent mentor and really went above and beyond to help me. I definitely achieved my
goals and would even say I exceeded them!" - Daniel Quintana, Psychology B.A., Class of 2023
"As a freshman I did not know anyone in the School of Education. My mentor, Dr. Weir,
connected me with other people in the department and now I know who to go to for help. Kerry
helped me connect my experiences with what I want to do and instilled confidence in me." -Eve
Azizi, Childhood Education- English, Class of 2023
"I am so glad I did the Sophomore Shadow Program. I learned so much and was able to connect
with people at OW and teachers who gave me great advice. I would not have known about all the
things I should be doing now to prepare for my career without this experience! I am excited to
continue on my journey!" - Briana Coreas, English B.A., Class of 2023
