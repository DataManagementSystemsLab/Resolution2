                                  Education

WHEREAS,    The School  of  Education  and  English  Department  have  found
          significant student interest in a 5 year program that will  result
          in a combined Bachelor of Arts in English and Master  of  Arts  in
          Teaching  English /Adolescence Education, and

WHEREAS,    The proposed 5  year  program  combines  two  existing  programs
          (Bachelor of Arts in  English  and  Master  of  Arts  in  Teaching
          English/ Adolescence Education) into one 5 year combined  program,
          and

WHEREAS,    The proposed  5  year  combined  B.A./M.A.T  will  allow  highly
          qualified students to complete both a Bachelor of Arts  degree  in
          English and a Master of  Arts  in  Teaching  English/  Adolescence
          Education  degree  in  5  years  by   accelerating   undergraduate
          coursework and taking graduate courses in their 4th year of study,
          and

WHEREAS,    The proposed 5 year program consists entirely  of  courses  that
          are already offered in the School of Education curriculum and  the
          curriculum of other departments involved  in  this  program,  thus
          mitigating the need for any additional resources, and

WHEREAS,    The proposed 5 year program allows students to fulfill  the  New
          York State requirement of obtaining a Masters degree in  order  to
          qualify for their teaching certification, and

WHEREAS,    The School  of  Education  has  determined  that  students  with
          Masters degrees have a higher  passing  rate  on  New  York  State
          teaching certification examinations.


THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED

      That the Senate approves the proposed Combined  Bachelor  of  Arts  in
          English/ Master of Arts in Teaching English/ Adolescence Education
          program.

                     Approved by CAP for submission to Senate, March 6, 2015
