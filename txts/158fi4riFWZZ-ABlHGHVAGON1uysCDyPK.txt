Whereas: A CUNY teach-in organized by the university's faculty and staff union, the

Professional Staff Congress aimed at creating "a safe harbor for people and ideas" in the
wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11".

And Whereas: Free speech is both the cornerstone of democracy and the guarantee of
free speech is central to the integrity of institutions of higher education.
And Whereas: Both the Trustees of the City University of New York and Matthew
Goldstein, the universityâ€™s chancellor appear to favor the curtailment of academic free
speech in their separate condemnations of professors who criticized U.S. foreign policy in
the context of that teach-in.
Therefore Be it Resolved: That the SUNY Old Westbury Faculty Senate, supporting the
free and open exchange of ideas in the academic context, deplores both actions.

To be sent to Chancellor Goldstein and the CUNY Board of Trustees
