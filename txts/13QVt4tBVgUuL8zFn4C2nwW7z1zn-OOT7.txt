VII. Fall 2021 Discussion
● Provost started this conversation on what to expect in the fall.

● Contingency planning, all aspect of what we get done on our campus falls under that.
● Healthy and safety, student and faculty choice, quality of instructional service and student
learning outcomes. These are the criteria within the contingency planning processing.
● We want to have something consistent, Library opening has deemed successful.
● As we reopen the library, we indicated we would have covid 19 capacities on available
classrooms and would limit overall density within the two floors available to students.
● Main level of the library, partitioned tech commons consistent with guiding principles
and limited access to circulation desk. Equity and access concerns are being addressed.
● Book sanitizer was purchased with CARES funds for library material
● Make use of all this best practice or two and a half semesters of mixed modalities in
preparation for fall instruction
● The fall will be more of a blend of modalities. Communicate to students as far as what we
heard from them by way of student survey. We want to provide our students with options
as they move into the fall. We are not anticipating 100% density return to our campus in
the fall.
● Contingency plan is considering 50% of the population be on campus. Which is subject
to change.
● With use of mixed modalities we will be able to communicate to our students that we
hear them. Some students are still concerned with health and safety and others are
looking for more face to face engagement.
● Concerns were raised and a full conversation was raised.
