Resolution on Investigating SUNY Family Leave Policies



Whereas,    SUNY Old Westbury’s policy on family  leave  for  teaching
      faculty is unclear and typically enacted on  an  ad  hoc  basis,
      and;

Whereas,    Pregnancy and birth, or the need to take care  of  a  sick
      family member, can be anticipated as occurring within the  lives
      of a predictable proportion of faculty members, and;

Whereas,    The College has recently  hired  a  large  cohort  of  new
      faculty, who are typically of an age to start families, and;

Whereas,    Faculty members who expect a new birth or adoption in  the
      middle of an academic semester  are  often  forced  to  take  an
      unpaid leave for the full semester, or pay  out  of  pocket  for
      replacement personnel, and;

Whereas,    Such  decisions  place  unreasonable  burdens  on  faculty
      members who must take time off due to family  obligations,  that
      impact their professional and personal lives, as well  as  their
      students’ classroom experiences, and;

Whereas,    Other regional public university systems,  such  as  CUNY,
      have incorporated  a  paid  parental  leave  policy  into  their
      contracts with full-time faculty members and professional staff,
      and;

Whereas     Paid family leave policies and flex time policies  enhance
      loyalty to the institution and sustain retention of faculty  and
      professional employees, and;

Whereas,    Ad-hoc provision of family leave policies lends itself  to
      the unequal provision of such, and;

Whereas,    SUNY College at Old Westbury ‘s strategic plan states  the
      college’ “Old Westbury promotes social justice and  equality  in
      living  and  learning  through  its   historic   commitment   to
      educational  empowerment,  diversity,  access,   equity,   self-
      determination,  community  activism   and   responsible   global
      citizenship.

      the specifics of SUNY Old Westbury’s  family  leave  policy  and
      flex  time  policy,  and  whether  such  policies  are   applied
      uniformly across the campus units, and;

       That the UUP  Vice  President  for  Academics  visits  the  Old
      Westbury campus for a forum to discuss adding paid family  leave
