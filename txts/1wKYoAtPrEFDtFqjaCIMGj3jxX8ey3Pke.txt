Faculty Senate Chair’s Report

Report that covid-

Pool of candidates for the VP in Institutional Advancement

Open to faculty and students on particular days 

Dates and RSVPs on Zoom will be in email 

Sent a list of nominations for presidential committees for his approval

There were amendments including the EIT committee (which was previously omitted)

Staff nominations were included as well

Letter drafted to the president regarding Hanover and Residential College Model 

This was sent after faculty input

Verbatim, some summaries

Hanover cost - $45,000

Feedback requested that Presidential Committees coordinate with current contemporaries

President will address these points in Faculty Senate meeting

Documents from Hanover shared with FS

First point is looking at Enrollment

Example survey with questions such as “where are you currently enrolled, applications, how they understand various universities, how did they decide on current college, 

Tuesday meeting with Cabinet – they will address this, if you have comments, send before then 

Sample analysis from Hanover – they investigate certain questions 

Survey questions are not vague – Cabinet will advise Hanover what type of questions we specifically want

Hanover is coordinating access to dashboards 

Some committees already have access (EC, Planning/Budget, IEC, PRODiG, LEC, CAP)

Broader access coordinating, perhaps president has specific timeline 

Mike Kavic – encourage participation in getting to know VP candidates for Institutional Advancement 

Question: were faculty on search committee?

Jo-Ann Robinson said as Chair of search committee she would send list of committee members – included faculty   



President’s Report

Addressing Hanover survey questions

Services that Hanover provides?

Generate reports about survey reports  

Digital portal – previous reports that anyone on campus can access

Access? 

hopefully everyone will have access soon but 

Alignment with strategic plan?

We shape this inquiry – at Cabinet level – it will make sure report design will specifically reflect our values 

Our strategic plan

Will reports affect enrollment and recruitment?

Yes, we want enrollment to improve

Lack of diversity?

We shape content – we need to make sure that our commitment to diversity and inclusion comes 

Why company chosen?

They represented best value for costs with what we get

Five vendors considered – they were the favorite – proven track record and highly regarded 

What they do, they provide proper service to link surveys with best practices

Hanover help other campuses?

Albany – and they’re checking with others

President has used at two other institutions 

Will Hanover consider history?

Yes, and it’s our responsibility to curate questions and inquiry to 

What is purpose of hiring consulting company?

It is not just for this project, but multiple projects a year

We have a library of white papers and research to help us advance our institution to transform into a best-practice college

Align inquiry with strategic ambitions

We need the data to help inform our progress 

They move quickly and accurately

What have they asked us?

We haven’t launched enrollment management piece, but we want our vision to drive this

Will there be consultation/collaboration with all units of college?

Yes, Cabinet will identify a member from campus to work with Hanover

Part of this work will be to solicit input from faculty which will shape Hanover inquiry

Cabinet will ensure that faculty input informs Hanover 

Enrollment: VP for Enrollment Monica Calzolari 

School Identity: Mike Kinane

Portfolio Optimization: talking to Jennie with who could do this

Will anyone be involved in data analysis?

Enrollment management will be in charge of section

Next project: what will you do about under-enrolled or underperforming majors?

As it relates to portfolio optimization, we want data-driven information about how to advance platform so we can improve those majors 

We need to ensure Hanover is doing what we request, so we know what to do with data so we can improve those underperforming majors or under-enrolled areas 

How do we ensure meaningful faculty and student consultation?

Each project leader will ensure appropriate constituents are consulted and we will make sure campus-wide vetting before shared with Cabinet before handing over to Hanover for inquiry   

Is outsourcing data analysis the direction our campus is going?

As incoming president, he wanted data, market-basket comparisons, and best practices analysis

Because Hanover can do national norming, compare to rest of nation, this will provide immediate data 

That doesn’t mean we won’t eventually try to build in house capacity

Money being generate for Hanover?

Partially funded by EAB and president’s budget

When Hanover finished, where will we get money for recommendations??

We ask that they bake into recommendations the possible funding models. 

Depending on the projects they recommend, we will try to build capacity for advancement-orientated packages to fund 

Why are we relying on consultants instead of community/institutional knowledge of faculty and staff?

That knowledge can’t be accessed as quickly as Hanover can work – in the future we can work on getting down that institutional knowledge so it can be informative  

Questions

Alireza Ebrahimi: Good to use data analytics to inform. How can we ensure that data that they are studying is accurate enough and is there any oversight? Is consultant separate entity?

Response: after proper vetting, we will be able to shape their inquiry. Cabinet’s point person will check the integrity question

Hanover is consultant: does not run the program, they give framework and we determine scope and direction – we engage to ensure it reflects what we want  

Martha Livingston: worried about transformation, does well even despite limited sources. What support are we getting? 

Response: direct purpose of strategic plan is continuously transforming itself – need data and best practices, innovation, those institutions make students excited

we need to compete with other places. We may have had a strong grasp on ‘under-representative minorities’ earlier, but now we are competing with other places. We need to identify where we can improve based on data 

Support will need more resources. We saw at Provost Council meeting. We’re going to continue to discuss. Expectations at public institutions increase but resources decrease 

Roger Mayer: brought up strategy of residency model and he understood about expanding net to draw in students. Questions: How will Hanover support? Is this a recognition that our student base is drying up? If drawing larger net, how will we differentiate ourselves from other institutions also drawing on dwindling numbers? 

Response: doesn’t want Residence to mean the same as Cohort- he wants to focus on creating cohort

Hanover will give us insight into where we can recruit

We primarily draw on LI students and some New Work and we will continue to flounder if we are limited to this group 

Hanover can tell what those groups regionally are interested in (New Jersey? Pennsylvania?) and how can we package our awesome programs so that specific packaging may resonate with specific regions

Roger Mayer emphasized that he wants to make sure that the President will 

President also mentioned he thinks we have great research and great programs and we need to message that better to help others see us and our excellence

Let’s identity those practices, and Hanover can help us quickly package that and let people know

Middle States 

We need to demonstrate across the campus assessment despite a decade of them indicating this to us

March 1 report must reflect

Everyone needs to engage, this is nothing that president can do himself 

Listed colleges that lost accreditation – want to highlight consequences of not working together 

Plan worked on, details will be shared with us soon – we have to demonstrate how we are ASSESSING students, not just planning to assess 

Assessment fellows will help 

Wants to thank fellows and those who are working hard on this 



Provost’s Report

Will show enrollment trend over the past 10 years another time

SUNY Implementation Guidance for General Education

Campus had opportunity to respond to guidance – took issue with GE framework and less with guidance but clearly communicated the desire to maintain integrity of LE curriculum  

Wondered if after Board of Trustees meeting next week we would have another chance to response before E

We had received memorenda to presidents to implement seamless transfer 

Recommend we implement task force

at the time of seamless transfer, Duncan was faculty senate chair, and nature of that requested was beyond what the curricular committee would manage over 1-year period

had a working force, task force – complementary work to implement that seamless transfer 

implementation 

need to address new students arriving on campus fall 2023

leaves faculty with 1-year period to address moving parts

a task force may help not only GE framework but also Registrar, DegreeWorks, communication to new and transfer students, and GETA General Education Transfer Addendum

we still have 7/10 areas but now

4 required

3 out of an additional 6 are required

2 core competencies 

We gave feedback but what we want to from governance (taskforce or LEC?) to have a side-by-side comparison. 

What was clear was that there were a few instances where guidance would identify what our campus expressed concern about

But new, broadly stated learning outcomes for areas, we’re going to need some mapping – two in particular

Knowledge: Communication (written and oral) – this would be new for us

Oral in particular

 Natural Science: as long as learning outcomes addressed, campus may make discipline substitutions (of courses normally in Natural Science domain)

But GE approval now campus level

Need to talk to senate – awaiting MTP in December  

Winter Shutdown Policy

Email from David Tomanio on Oct 22: during this period from December 23-January 2, we will close NAB and SU (Student Union), so anyone working or planning to work would need re-assigned space

Talked to library director

Perhaps small areas of Campus Center 

Encouraged to use compensatory time or accrued time 

Martha Livingston: does this make sense for UUP members? Professionals find bad. Closing my building and telling me to take paid time off or working elsewhere doesn’t provide good conditions to work

What about working remotely for those who can do so effectively 

President Sams response: we don’t have a policy in place yet to reflect this and we’re looking into it – perhaps possible in the future.

Student Withdrawing

Academic affairs supports success agenda – if there are reports of students who are being withdrawn that don’t include their initiation 

Report to deans or academic affairs so we can support students 

Runi Mukherji clarified: who are we reporting?

If students come to us for withdrawal that’s okay

If there are some with compliance issues regarding vaccines, etc where they are automatically withdrawn 

LMS Migration

SUNY has engaged new learning management system – Blackboard 

Details discussed what tools will migrate/be integrated 

EIT accessibility report – we recognized accessibility concerns with digital content – we want all students to access 

This is Old Westbury practice, not SUNY

Concern about workload – so vendor CourseArc will help faculty get documents in EIT accessibility compliance 

Chandra will coordinate between vendor and faculty 

International Education

SUNY Review of study abroad – standardized guiding principles for study abroad that may occur in spring/summer 2022

Want clear disposition 

Last year during Pandemic, SUNY chartered private flights to bring back students from Europe and Far East 

Concerns about liability insurance costs – don’t want students to be on the hook for costs if they have to be flown home 

Encouraging COIL experiences 

Perhaps we can explore more in-depth later 

UUP Report (Martha Livingston)

We were part of two meetings with state-wide leadership regarding proposals for negotiating next contract 

Eager to hear concerns, state-wide survey sent to everyone 

Addressing safety and compliance issues that we’re still concerned about

Example is the Open House 

We have department rep structure – look for in inbox

Planning UUP activity on Mon 15/Tues 16 – information to follow 

University Faculty Senate Report (Laurie Morris)

Enrollment – major revenue source and we’re seeing numbers decrease even before the pandemic (over a decade)

Impacts some sectors more than others 

Chancellor acknowledges need more funding sources, and Chair Tisch thought the new governor was SUNY-friendly

Falling enrollment is problem because enrollment is best factor to determine health of college

Tisch said petitioning legislature for more funding, including things like child care for students 

We should also lobby local rep

Decline over 10 years – biggest change is in comprehensive colleges (like Old Westbury) but so have community colleges

Doctoral universities are growing and tech centers are holding stable

Biggest loss under-representative minorities 

Perhaps worst hit by pandemic – accessibility, relatives affected,

Demographics

18-24 decrease in this population number, larger growth in age 25-44 (Chancellor interchanged life-long and adult learners)

We need to attract these older students as well as those out of high school 

New course offerings? Micro credentials? Perhaps these would help adult learners 

Seemed to stress desire for in-person classes but appreciates need for flexibility 

Should we make SAT or GRE voluntary rather than mandatory

Provost says SUNY will investigate 

Old Westbury’s strengths need to be communicated to Chancellor first so the SUNY Central can notify students which campuses have which strengths

Local network and outreach programs (attract high school students)

Renovating older structures – 

Building campus-based endowments (alumni association) – build our own coffers 

Acknowledged need for state money for buildings and support student success services 

Budget little said

Chair optimistic that Governor Hochul would be interested in learning about SUNY   

Anticipated 20% EOP funding 

$250,000 share our strength non-profit for food assistance to SUNY students (esp. those with children) 

COVID-19

98.8% SUNY students vaccinated 2.5% exempted. 98% on-campus presence in compliance

3,200 students non-compliment most on 10 campuses and are non-residential students 

90% compliance state-wide for faculty

Perhaps some have not reported because they are vaccinated but not in person 

Fall 2021

375,000 enrolled, 250,000 in-person

Campuses can make stringent requirements but most reflect CDC guidance 

Gen Ed Update

Board will make final determination – possibly approved by Board

Drafts drawn up and feedback collected

Implementation guidance, and final guidance in December – and ask Duncan said, pushed back implementation to Fall 2023

This is foundational framework – campuses can build on it

MUST work with seamless transfer 

Probably cannot require more than 60 credits 

Many wanted to keep Diversity, mostly concerns with limited definition (race, class, gender) rather than other categories 

It can enhance requirements – if Provost thought students need more well-rounded education, can add Art, elected categories, etc
