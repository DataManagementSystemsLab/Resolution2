Resolution Reorganization of Academic Units
Background:
In January 2004 the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate requested the Governance Committee to
examine the issues surrounding the establishment of the School of Nanotechnology at the University at
Albany. To that end the two committee co-chairs visited the Albany campus on two occasions in
February and April 2004, meeting with faculty critical of the process and with faculty and the Dean of the
School of Nanotechnology.
As noted in the Report to the Executive Committee, there are differing perceptions on the question of
whether the governance process broke down. However, as noted in the Report, “that, by itself, indicates

that there were not a set of procedural expectations shared by the faculty leadership, the administrative
leadership, and the leadership within the School of Nanotechnology.”

A clear understanding of governance procedures by all segments of the campus community is central to

the success of the governance process, and clear and frequent communication about procedural
expectations facilitates such an understanding. To that end, the following resolution is offered:

Whereas increasing pressures upon the campuses of the university to become more responsive to the

economic development priorities of the state and the communities in which they are located, as well as
budgetary pressures to increase efficiency make it likely that reorganizations of academic units will occur
with greater frequency than in the past, and

Whereas the organizational structure of the campus has a profound impact upon matters of research and
instruction, whose primary responsibility rests with the faculty, and
Whereas a broadly understood and carefully articulated consultative process enables the faculty to
effectively discharge its governance responsibilities,
Now therefore be it Resolved:
1)

2)

3)

that the University Faculty Senate recommends to Campus Governance Leaders that each campus
should have, within its by-laws, an explicit process for reviewing proposals for academic
reorganization, an explicit process for the review, prior to the submission of proposals to System
Administration, of new academic programs and an explicit process for the approval of, and
changes to, the curriculum.
that the University Faculty Senate recommends to Campus Governance Leaders that upon the
appointment of all new academic administrators (e.g,, Dean, Vice President for Academic
Affairs, President), the chair of the governance body should communicate with the new
appointee, apprising the appointee of the extant process of consultation, and reminding the
appointee that all changes to the process must emanate through the normal governance
mechanisms, and

that the University Faculty Senate recommends to Campus Governance Leaders that as part of its
periodic review of governance, the local governance body should review the consultative process,
and even where adequate and working well, should use the opportunity to reacquaint the campus
community with the process.
