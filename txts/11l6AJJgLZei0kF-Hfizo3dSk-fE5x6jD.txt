Faculty Governance Orientation (October 4, 2019)
Some Procedural Basics/Rules of Order
Point of Information
Prepared by Parliamentarian (Maureen Dolan)
(initial presentation at 9/21/18 Faculty Senate Meeting)

Background:
• The SUNY Old Westbury Faculty Senate follows basic parliamentary procedure,
consistent with standard practices of the University Faculty Senate (UFS).
• The Chair of the Faculty Senate, also referred to by SUNY as the Campus
Governance Leader (CGL), presides over Senate and Faculty meetings.
• The Chair has considerable discretion in meeting conduct and procedures (with
occasional input from the Parliamentarian, when appropriate).
Some Procedural Basics:
• Scheduled speakers and scheduled reports have the Senate floor for the time allotted
on published meeting agenda.
• An agenda item may (or may not) include time for Q&A or comment period. The
Chair has discretion to extend agenda time (or not) for Q&A or comment period.
• Senators are normally expected to allow scheduled speakers to conclude their
remarks or reports before any Q&A or comment period.
• A Senator raising a “Point of Information” may interrupt a scheduled speaker to
seek clarification − or to provide clarification − of a specific point. This is not
considered an infraction of Order.
“Order on Senate Floor” during Q&A or comment period:
• Persons with questions or comments should raise their hand to be recognized. Such
persons will normally be recognized by the Chair in sequence of hands raised. (The
Chair may defer to the scheduled speaker to conduct the Q&A.)
• A Senator may “yield time” to a person having a question or comment who is a
visitor to the Senate, and who raised their hand to be recognized.
• The Chair may also ask that a Senator please yield time to a non-Senator− so that the
visitor may have the floor.
Consideration of Resolutions (some basics):
• Resolutions are typically presented to the Senate under New Business, then debated
and acted upon in a subsequent meeting as Old Business. This provides opportunity
for Senators to discuss Resolutions with colleagues and constituency groups.

Consideration of Resolutions (some basics, continued):

• Resolutions are typically presented to the Senate under New Business, then debated
and acted upon in a subsequent meeting as Old Business. This provides opportunity
for Senators to discuss Resolutions with colleagues and constituency groups.
• If a Resolution deals with time-sensitive matter(s), the Chair has discretion to allow
the Resolution presentation/discussion/debate and action in a single session.
• Resolutions are normally read into the record by sponsor(s). The Chair may allow a
summary instead of complete reading of Resolution when text is lengthy.
• Resolutions need a Second in order to open floor to debate. The Chair is responsible
for conducting debate (with possible occasional input from Parliamentarian).
• Senators will argue For or Against the Resolution or motion on the floor. Extraneous
commentary, speaking out of turn, or lack of courtesy may be ruled “Out of Order”.
• During debate, the Chair will recognize speakers per basic rules of Order
previously described (under Q&A/comment period). The Chair has discretion to limit
speaker(s) to an allotted time, especially when many are in queue waiting to speak.
• Amendments to a Resolution or motion on the floor must be considered prior to
action on body of Resolution. Amendments/motions need a Second to be considered.
• During debate, when considering amendments and related motions, it may be
appropriate for most recent amendment proposed to be the first amendment disposed.
The body of a Resolution may also be divided or considered by paragraph.

Voting (a few basics):
• The Chair has discretion when to move to a vote. The Chair may sometimes ask for
an informal “Sense of the Senate” to determine if unanimous consent is feasible.
• A Senator may seek to end debate by “Calling the Question”. In this instance, the
Senate will vote whether or not to end debate on the motion or matter on the floor.
“Yes” vote on “Calling the Question” will end debate; the Chair will then move to a
vote on the motion or matter on the floor. “No” vote will continue debate.
• Voting on a Resolution, amendment or motion is in the form of Yes, No or Abstain;
voting may be by voice or hand count. Ex officio members of Senate do not vote.
Voting by paper ballot (confidential) may also possibly be requested by Senator(s), as
provided for under the Bylaws.
• In addition to voting whether or not to approve a Resolution or motion on the floor,
a motion or agenda item may also be Withdrawn (e.g., for modification); Referred
or Recommitted to committee; Tabled to suspend temporarily consideration/action;
or Postponed to a specific time.
