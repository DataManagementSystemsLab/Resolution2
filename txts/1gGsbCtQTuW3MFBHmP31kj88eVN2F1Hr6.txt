lam glad to see that the students care about this, and that they have done
their homework. There was faculty involvement, but there was no formal
faculty governance involvement, and that_is not the intent of the
resolution.

Also, although all_ the buildings on campus need rehab, the AV

should carry the biggest weight.

The question is how to commend the students for their concern about this
issue, but not do something as disruptive as a vote of no confidence.

Senate Chair asked the AVP if he might put a student on the continuing MR II

committee, and he agreed to consider it.
AVP: I told System that major revisions were needed in the Mission Review II
document. We should be concerned about our image and credibility at System. We
should not act hastily. If there is a vote of no confidence or condemnation, it will have

serious repercussions and it would interfere with my ability to function effectively with
System.
e Perhaps one solution would be to rethink the resolution so that the
whereasâ€™

become the body of the resolution as the issues which should be

focused on in MR II?

M. Foglino agreed to withdraw the resolution and take it back to the SGA.
