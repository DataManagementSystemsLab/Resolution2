I. Membership
The 2017‐2018 TLRC consisted of seven elected/appointed members and two ex‐officio members. On the last meeting of
2016‐2017 (May 2017), Jill Crocker was elected as 2017‐2018 chair. On the first meeting in September 2017, Ashlee Lien was
elected as vice chair, and Ashok Basawapatna was elected as secretary.

This committee membership reflects the 2016 Bylaws change that increased the size of the TLRC from six to seven elected
members, including representation from each of the three schools and the library. We have found this composition to be a
welcome improvement.
II. Activities
During the 2017‐2018 academic year, the TLRC hosted a fall New Faculty Orientation, spring Mini‐Conference, two workshops,
and four roundtables. In addition, we collaborated with the OER Task Force to bring SUNY OER Services to campus for a faculty
info‐session in the fall, and again in the spring for a full day OER Workshop. We co‐sponsored UUP’s annual “Getting to
Tenure” workshop, and converted an under‐utilized website to an easier to access and easier to maintain SUNY OW LibGuide
with a variety of teaching‐related resources (e.g. links to GenEd Learning Objectives, the final exam schedule, etc.)
While in the preceding year TLRC had co‐sponsored Applied Learning Info Sessions (with the Applied Learning Campus Team),
in spring 2018 we were charged (along with representatives from CAP and LEC, a liaison from the Applied Learning Campus
Team and a representative of the FS Executive Committee) with developing a proposal for integrating the responsibility of
tagging and supporting Applied Learning courses into faculty governance (proposal submitted to FS Executive Committee
4/4/18). In addition, TLRC took on the responsibility of serving in an advisory capacity to the newly formed Center for
Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL), in partial fulfillment of a 2012 FS Resolution that called for such a center and an
enhanced institutional commitment to teaching excellence (discussed at FS on 2/9/2018). It is our hope that as it becomes
established, CETL (currently coordinated through SAS) can help fulfill the ongoing demand for teaching development
opportunities, as the TLRC’s capacity to do so is limited.
In addition to these activities (also listed below), the chair participated in the two‐day “Global Service Learning Institute” in
Syracuse, NY in June 2017 and the TLRC held a total of eight business meetings (4 per semester), along with regular online
discussions.
III. Reflections and Future Plans
TLRC events were well attended this year, with some especially lively discussions in our roundtable format. We continue to be
committed to providing teaching development opportunities and resources, helping create spaces that foster faculty
connection, and addressing teaching‐related issues as they arise. The TLRC relies heavily on the expertise and participation of
our colleagues to develop successful initiatives, and always welcomes suggestions/volunteers for presenters. We aren’t able to
incorporate every idea into the schedule, but we do maintain a running list of possible topics and presenters. In the meantime,
we look forward to seeing folks at our annual New Faculty Meet & Greet (Friday September 21, 2018)!
