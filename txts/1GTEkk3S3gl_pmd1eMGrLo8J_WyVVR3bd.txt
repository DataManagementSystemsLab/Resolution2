Resolution to Require the Explicit Inclusion and Identification of a
            “Social Justice Component” in Every Academic Program

Whereas, the College’s mission articulates the following, “Old Westbury
weaves the values of integrity, community engagement, and global
citizenship into the fabric of its academic programs and campus life. In an
environment that cultivates critical thinking, empathy, creativity and
intercultural understanding, we endeavor to stimulate a passion for
learning and a commitment to building a more just and sustainable world,”
and

Whereas, the current curriculum, as described in the Undergraduate and
Graduate Bulletins does not explicitly identify any particular “social
justice components,” and

Whereas, the identity of the College to its students, faculty and staff, as
well as to the universe of potential students, and within SUNY, does not
emphasize the social justice qualities central to the College’s mission,
and

Whereas, the SUNY Student Opinion Survey of spring 2012 indicates that Old
Westbury is failing to graduate students who exemplify the College’s
mission, and

Whereas, the historical reliance on “informal” means to incorporate social
justice into the curriculum has failed in establishing social justice as an
integral component in the educational experience for students, and this
failure is likely to be further exacerbated by factors related to the
implementation of seamless transfer, and

Whereas, only through the conscious, intentional and explicit insertion of
a “social justice component” into each individual academic department’s
curriculum can the College live up to its mission and make real its
rhetoric, and

Whereas, the nature and quality of individual disciplines requires that the
ways in which the social justice mission of the College might best be
articulated in those disciplines will vary;

Therefore Be It Resolved, That every academic department shall identify and
establish an explicit and integrated “social justice component” in the
curriculum for every major, minor or certificate program sponsored or
offered by that academic department, and

Be it Further Resolved, That each such “social justice component” meet a
college-wide standard to be established and monitored by the Curriculum and
Academic Planning Committee, and

Be it Further Resolved, That such requirements be explicitly identified as
such in major and program descriptions, and

Be it Further Resolved, That the Academic Deans and the Provost shall
foster and facilitate the inclusion of a “social justice component” in each
academic major, program or certificate, including appropriate resources and
staffing.
