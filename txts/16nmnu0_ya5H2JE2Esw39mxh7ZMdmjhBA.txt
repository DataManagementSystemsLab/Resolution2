   2.  Assessment of General Education

   Domain assessment of Western Tradition was done in Summer 2014, based on
   course materials from Spring 2014.  (Report was sent to Chair after her
   term was up.  It is included in file of hard copies of agendas.)

   Domain reviews for Basic Communications and American Experience were
   completed by May 2014, based on materials gathered in Spring 2014.

   3. Bylaws Review

In mid-March 2014, the GEC chair sent to the Faculty Senate chair a set of
recommendations for changes to the Faculty Bylaws concerning the General
Education Committee.

   4.  SUNY Seamless Transfer

As reported to the Faculty Senate last year by L. Barber, in 2012-2013 the
Provost gave permission for GE courses so designated to fulfill two domain
requirements; that is, a student can fulfill two GE requirements with a
single course.  As noted above, one of seven courses applications reviewed
by the GEC  was approved for double designation.  Allowance for dual
designation gained further significance in one of the GEC’s major
initiatives in 2013- 2014: response to the Faculty Senate on GE in Seamless
Transfer.



With other campuses in the SUNY system, Old Westbury was mandated to
respond with appropriate reviews and changes to the “Memorandum to [SUNY
campus] Presidents” (MtP) issued in June 2013, which in turn refers to SUNY
Board of Trustees Resolution 2012-089 “Seamless Transfer Requirements” as a
basis for this initiative for campuses.  The pressing stipulations in
Section I.A. of that resolution that GEC needed to respond to were:

              i. 30 credits in a minimum of SUNY-GER [General Education
                 Requirement] areas

             ii. SUNY-GER Mathematics and Basic Communication are required…

           iv    Campuses shall review existing programs leading to a …
           bachelor’s degree, to determine whether the SUNY- GER can be
           completed during the first two years of study….

      Through extensive discussion and various levels of consultation,
      including an open meeting with campus faculty on March 11, 2014, the
      GEC drafted, finalized and approved a document on Seamless Transfer
      that was submitted to the Faculty Senate Executive Committee.  The FS
      EC, under direction of then chair Duncan Quarless, incorporated the
      GEC response into its document, “Executive Summary on Seamless
      Transfer (ST)” dated April 18, 2014 and circulated to campus faculty
      in early May 2014.

      In Fall 2013, then FS Chair Duncan Quarless called together an Ad Hoc
      Subcommittee on GE in Seamless Transfer, which reported
      recommendations at a special meeting of the Faculty Senate in January
      2014.  The GEC rejected the principle recommendation of the
      Subcommittee, to reduce the number of required GE domains to seven, by
      allowing choice between some of them.  Instead, the recommendations
      the GEC put forth allowed for reduction of GE credit loads by the
      following:

         • Distinguish local GE requirements not mandated by SUNY as a
           separate category of College requirements, to include English
           Composition 2 and the Diversity domain.

         • Create or redesignate sufficient GE courses with dual domains to
           allow students to complete GE with 32 credits; that is, with up
           to two dual-designated courses.




   5. Other Initiatives and Changes



   Early in the Fall 2013 semester, the Provost stated that he would review
   all GEC-approved courses before sending to SUNY for approval.   While the
   GEC was reviewing applications for new courses, he was not allowing upper-
   division courses into GE.  In Spring 2014, he communicated to the
   Committee that he would allow some 3000-level courses into the program.




   In Summer 2014 the Provost decided to fill the position of Director of
   General Education—an administrative position—with an administrator rather
   than the GEC Chair .   As the position is now defined, one of the
   Director’s responsibilities will be to prepare the General Education
   Bulletin, in collaboration with the GEC Chair and committee.   The last
   GE Bulletin, dated October 2013, was produced by Yumi Nicholson of the
   Academic Advising Center, who serves on the GEC, in collaboration with
   the Committee.
