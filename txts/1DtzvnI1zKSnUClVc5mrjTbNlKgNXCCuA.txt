Resolution of Residence 2.0 Policy for First-Year Students



Whereas SUNY Old Westbury is the only known campus in the United States
that expels students from its residence halls if they fall below a 2.0 GPA
in their first or second semester of their first-year, with no opportunity
for appeal;

Whereas the 2.0 Residence Hall Policy is not consistent with and
contradicts Old Westbury’s academic policy with regard to GPA, probation,
suspension and dismissal;

Whereas this policy is unjust, discriminatory and in direct opposition to
the College’s mission, since it disproportionately impacts low income
students and students of color, who are more likely to live on campus;

Whereas best practices student success and retention recognize that the
first year of college is a period of adjustment academically and socially;

Whereas this policy punishes students rather than supporting their
development, negatively impacting their lives and ability to persist in
college and graduate;

Whereas there are more productive evidence-based policies for promoting
academic excellence;

Whereas this policy tarnishes the Old Westbury’s reputation, negatively
impacting our retention and graduation rate;

Whereas the Faculty Senate has passed resolutions strongly opposing this
policy three times in the past eight years since its enforcement;

Therefore, be it resolved that the Faculty Senate strongly urges the
administration to revoke the 2.0 Residence Hall Policy for first-time to
college and transfer students in their first-year, recognizing that
academic policy should drive residence hall policy, and not the other way
around.
