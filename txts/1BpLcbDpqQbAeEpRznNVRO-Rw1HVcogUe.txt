Resolution Presented by Academic Policy Committee
(Approved by APC (5-0-0) on October 28, 2003)

Whereas there has previously been a SUNY System Administration mandate
against noting majors on diplomas;
And, whereas SUNY has recently decided that this mandate is outdated and has

granted individual institutions the authority to note majors on diplomas if they
so desire;
And, whereas there have been many student requests for such notation in the
past;

Therefore, be it resolved that the faculty authorizes the noting of academic
majors on student diplomas.
