                   Resolution on Sexual Assault Prevention

Whereas, sexual assault is a continuing concern for institutions of higher
education;  and

Whereas New York State and SUNY are committed to taking great care in
protecting the safety and well-being of all of its students, employees and
personnel and to creating and maintaining a safe educational and learning
environment free from all sexually related harms, whether occurring on or
off campus; and

Whereas, the problem of sexual assault within college communities has
gained increasing national awareness, including at the Federal
Congressional level; and

Whereas, this increased awareness has led more colleges and universities to
reassess the effectiveness of policies and enforcement regarding all Title
IX violations and identify new approaches to prevention; and

Whereas, California enacted SB967 on Student Safety: Sexual Assault,
commonly known as the “Yes Means Yes” law, in September 2014; and

Whereas, the State University of New York Board of Trustees passed a
resolution, Sexual Assault Response and Prevention, on October 2, 2014, at
the urging of Governor Cuomo, that will establish uniform policies and
procedures across all SUNY campuses regarding sexual assault response and
training; and

Whereas, the SUNY Board of Trustees, in consultation with Governor Cuomo,
appointed Linda Fairstein to serve as a special adviser for the
implementation of the sexual assault response and prevention policy;
therefore

Be It Resolved that the University Faculty Senate endorses and supports the
SUNY initiative on sexual assault response and prevention; and

Be It Further Resolved that the University Faculty Senate recommends to the
Chancellor that SUNY System Administration and Special Adviser Linda
Fairstein work in collaboration with the University Faculty Senate in the
development and implementation of effective and fair policies and
procedures to meet the goals of the Board of Trustees resolution.

  Resolution Requesting All State University of New York Campuses Offering
  Athletics Create Programs to Support Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender
                        Athletes, Coaches, and Staff
        and to Prevent Anti-LGBT Bias and Discrimination in Athletics

Whereas, SUNY is one of the country’s largest and most diverse state
university systems and understands that diversity is “an integral component
of academic excellence”; and

Whereas, 55 of SUNY’s campuses have athletics programs which offer over 800
sports teams and participation by approximately 14,000 student athletes;
and

Whereas, athletics, intramurals, and club sports play a significant role in
the overall education of our students; and

Whereas, athletic programs are used to promote the SUNY system, to recruit
students, to retain students, to build campus identity and school spirit,
and to grow and solicit alumni and foundation donations; and

Whereas, college athletic programs have historically served as spaces for
cultural, ethnic, and racial integration, helped grow more diverse campus
communities, and allowed for introduction of valuable cultural
competencies; and

Whereas, employers value the transferable skills—communication, leadership,
time management, reflection, ability to take criticism, and how to
effectively work with others toward a common goal—learned by student-
athletes; and

Whereas, team membership connects student-athletes to internship and career
opportunities through networks of alumni and former athletes; and

Whereas, SUNY graduates serve as teachers, coaches, and administrators in
our public schools and serve as role models for the students they interact
with; and

Whereas, there is a history of explicit and implicit bias and intimidation
against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender athletes, coaches, and staff;
and

Whereas, college athletic programs should be safe spaces for all students
who wish to participate, including Out and Gender non-conforming athletes,
coaches, and staff; therefore

Be it resolved that the University Faculty Senate requests that SUNY System
Administration, through individual campus Presidents and their designees,
work with Directors of Athletics and Student Government organizations to
develop systematic programs that support LGBT athletes, coaches and staff
and prevent any anti-LGBT bias and discrimination in all sports on each of
its campuses, and

Be it further resolved this program be instituted by the 2015-2016 school
year.

          Resolution on SUNY Excels Performance Measurement System

Whereas the State University of New York system recognizes that its
strength lies in a “geographically distributed comprehensive system of
diverse campuses which shall have differentiated and designated missions…”
and,

Whereas the principle of shared governance has a long-standing role in the
development of college and university strategic planning with the 1966
Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities declaring that “The
framing and execution of long-range plans… should be a central and
continuing concern of the academic community,” involving input from all
participants in campus governance; and

 Whereas performance measurement systems are designed to measure the
results of services or programs  and the selection of specific measures
often directs organizational activities and resources; and,

Whereas the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools’
accreditation requires its members to demonstrate institutional
effectiveness with outcome measures; and,

Whereas the success of performance measurement systems depends upon the
active participation and support of all stakeholder groups responsible for
implementing them including faculty; and,

Whereas the State University of New York system has been engaged in the
development of SUNY Excel, a performance measurement system for both the
system and its campuses since 2013; and,

Whereas the four leadership meetings held across the state of New York in
December, 2013 offered limited participation by faculty representatives in
attendance; and,

Whereas the process for developing campus level outcomes and indicators
does not include steps to consult with faculty to discuss the potential
impact of indicators on the missions of campuses, programs or departments;
and,

Whereas the implementation of performance measurement systems are more
successful when they are reviewed and revised as all stakeholders gain
knowledge about the processes and their outcomes; now, therefore

Be it resolved that support of the SUNY Excels program by the University
Faculty Senate is contingent upon satisfactorily addressing the following:

    • Both individual campuses and the SUNY system engage all participants
      in governance including faculty, staff and students in the development
      and implementation of campus specific performance measures that are
      integrally linked to their unique institutional missions;



    • Each campus, through the existing shared governance process(es), and
      SUNY carefully assess the impacts of pursuing conflicting performance
      measures simultaneously;

    • SUNY and its respective campuses,  through the existing shared
      governance process(es), select and use measures which directly support
      the core academic missions of the institutions;

    • SUNY and its institutions,  through the existing shared governance
      process(es), systematically review the validity and reliability of
      their performance measures on an annual basis;  and,

    • SUNY adopt procedures for amending performance measures and their
      systems as part of a process of continuous improvement for the System
      and its campuses.

 Resolution on Affordability of Textbooks and Other Instructional Materials

Whereas the mission of the State University of New York (SUNY) is to
provide the people of New York State with educational services of the
highest quality and with the broadest possible access; and

Whereas the cost of higher education borne by students including those
attending SUNY has risen in recent years; and

Whereas the cost of education can be prohibitive, affect access and
affordability, and contribute to indebtedness for students and their
families; and

Whereas the increased cost of textbooks and other instructional materials
contributes to the overall increase in the cost of higher education; and

Whereas ensuring that students have access to textbooks and related
materials is consistent with SUNY’s mission and integral to student
success; and

Whereas textbooks are continuously updated and it is not general policy or
within the scope of the budgets of libraries to purchase textbooks as part
of their academic holdings; and

Whereas faculty instructional copies may not be copyright compliant for use
in library reserves; and

Whereas the Chancellor on October 23, 2014, announced the SUNY Affordable
Learning Solutions initiative as part of International Open Access Week;
and

Whereas on November 9, 2013, the General Assembly of the Student Assembly
of the State University of New York passed the Textbook Affordability
Solutions Resolution #1314-40;  THEREFORE

Be it resolved that the University Faculty Senate (UFS) asks the Chancellor
to work with campus Presidents to implement the Student Assembly of the
State University of New York’s Resolution #1314-40; and

Be it further resolved that the UFS asks the Chief Academic Officer on each
campus to work with the Campus Governance Leader to consider faculty to
adopt textbooks from all phases of Open SUNY  Textbooks and other open
textbook sources and be encouraged to author such resources; and

Be it further resolved that the UFS asks the Chief Academic Officer on each
campus to work with the Campus Governance Leader to increase faculty
knowledge of low or no cost textbook alternatives.

 Resolution on Reduction on the Maximum Working Hours for Student Assistants

Whereas the mission of the State University of New York (SUNY) is to
provide the people of New York State with educational services of the
highest quality and with the broadest possible access; and

Whereas the cost of higher education borne by students including those
attending SUNY has risen in recent years; and

Whereas the cost of education can be prohibitive, affect access and
affordability, and contribute to indebtedness for students and their
families; and

Whereas a student’s inability to earn sufficient wages could result in lack
of persistence toward graduation, and/or delayed graduation; and

Whereas previous recommendations from the Provost's Office and the Student
Affairs Office state that students who are in good academic standing may be
allowed to work more than 20 hours per week and students who are struggling
academically should continue to be limited to 20 hours per week when
classes are in session; and

Whereas the SUNY Human Resources document 8300 policy of September 1, 2014,
 has limited student assistant working hours to twenty-nine (29) per week
may present a significant financial hardship;

Therefore Be it resolved that the University Faculty Senate requests that
SUNY System Administration work with the State of New York to remove the
limitation on student assistant working hours; and

Be it further resolved that the University Faculty Senate urges the
Chancellor to support any and all other efforts to provide students with
insurance options so that student working hours not be limited.

 Resolution in support of expanding SUNY undergraduate research and creative
                                  endeavors


Whereas undergraduate education, basic research, and applied research are
fundamental components of SUNY’s mission statement; and

Whereas undergraduate research is understood in the broadest sense to mean
hands-on, applied learning and creative endeavor in laboratories, studios,
performance venues, and field sites; and

Whereas the Chancellor, in her 2014 State of the University address stated,
“Our goal is that every SUNY student has an applied learning experience by
graduation;” and

Whereas applied learning experiences such as undergraduate research
opportunities increase student persistence toward degree completion,
particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and

Whereas the Research Foundation for SUNY has dedicated funding for summer
undergraduate research opportunities as well as education and outreach
funding for the Networks of Excellence; therefore

Be it resolved that the University Faculty Senate supports the goal of
expanding research opportunities for undergraduate students; and

Be it resolved that the University Faculty Senate supports our colleagues
in their efforts to strengthen curricula that prepare students for
undergraduate research;and

Be it resolved that the University Faculty Senate supports our colleagues
in their efforts to further develop creative ways to infuse undergraduate
research into existing curricula, and where appropriate, to provide
extracurricular research opportunities; and

Be it resolved that the University Faculty Senate encourages SUNY and
campus administration to provide greater resources (funding, time, space,
credit), to our colleagues who regularly inspire, educate, and mentor
undergraduate researchers.
