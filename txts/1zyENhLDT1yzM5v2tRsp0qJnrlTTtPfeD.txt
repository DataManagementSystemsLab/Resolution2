Section 33—Still does not address student concerns about transportation services and their impact on

retention.
Section 35—Does not address the state of the budget for repair and renovation for the Academic
Village, nor questions of land use, as suggested.
Section 36—According to the Campus Capital Plan, the Academic Village cannot be said to be “in
compliance with” ADA regulations, in terms of elevators, bathrooms, door hardware, corridor width,

water fountains, switch heights, alarm systems, signage. [While the AV may come under technical

e

exception as an older building, a number of these features could and ought to be altered/ repaired.]
Section 37—Does not provide time frame for renovations and repair, as suggested.

Finally, as the Senate pursues its deliberations regarding substantive proposed changes in academic life and
structure—especially the establishment of graduate programs, pursuit of certifications, establishment of schools
and installation of deans—the Chair would urge them to reflect on the relationship they have had and wish to

have with the senior administration, and with each other.

as much as we can with the resources we have?

Have we all—faculty, staff, and administration—done

Would we express resignation to failure in that regard by hiring

yet other administrators to do the jobs we have not been able to accomplish yet? Have we done as much as we
can to communicate fairly and honestly, and keep the best interests of the College—indeed, ultimately the
students—in mind? Have we consulted effectively with all concerned before taking action; and have we taken

our guidance from those people and principles by whom we are best served?

Have we stood up strongly

enough for the good, and taken courage to speak our minds about the wrong, while remaining judicious and

collegial? Certainly, as Chair I have seen good signs of courage and wisdom in the work of the Senate this
semester. Let us continue.
